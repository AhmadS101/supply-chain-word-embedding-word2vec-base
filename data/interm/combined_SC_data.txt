supply chain is made up of interconnected parts of a whole, all of which add up to finished products bought by customers. Take automobiles, for example. Before a consumer buys a car, iron ore is extracted from the earth. The ore is transported to a plant, where it’s turned into steel, which is made into the chassis of the automobile. To make the car, various components—from engines to batteries, electrical components, rubber tires, a metal body, and paint—are assembled. Once the car is made, it’s sold in a retail setting to the end consumer.

That’s a good illustration of several types of supply chain stakeholders:

    producers, which make or grow the raw materials for goods
    vendors, which buy and sell materials
    manufacturers, which make materials into goods
    transporters, or logistics providers, which move those goods around the world
    supply chain managers, which ensure that operations run smoothly in everything from planning to sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, delivery, and returns
    retailers, which sell goods either online or in physical stores
    consumers, who buy and use those goods and services

What’s the difference between value chains and supply chains?

A supply chain includes all the raw materials and parts that are made into a product and distributed up the chain for manufacture and sale. In contrast, a value chain encompasses all the individual steps that are taken to create a marketable product. That includes not only physical components but also various value-adding activities that might be classified as part of the “knowledge economy”—things such as innovation, design, marketing, and sales—and that lead to the development of a product ready for customers.
What is supply chain disruption?

When any link in a supply chain isn’t working optimally, you might say the supply chain has been disrupted. Different issues can emerge. For example, an increase in inbound material costs because one material costs more this year than it did last year can have major implications on a company’s cost structure. Or labor market mismatches can cause operational concerns—for instance, if transport companies can’t find enough people who want to drive trucks to deliver goods.

There are five areas where supply chain vulnerabilities most often show up:

    planning and supplier networks
    transportation and logistics systems
    financial resiliency
    product complexity
    organizational maturity

McKinsey research suggests that supply chain disruptions lasting one month or longer now occur every 3.7 years, on average. And these disruptions can have a steep price: they cost the average organization 45 percent of a year’s profits over the course of a decade.

What are some supply chain risks?

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has delivered the biggest supply chain or value chain shock in recent memory, other examples abound. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II, as well as supply chain disruptions in critical sectors, including agriculture, automotive, energy, and food. Changes in the environment and global economy have increased the frequency and magnitude of these shocks. For instance, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan shut down electronics factories, and 2017’s Hurricane Harvey disrupted US oil refineries and petrochemical plants, ultimately leading to shortages of some plastics and resins critical to different industries.

McKinsey has classified supply chain shocks into four different types, based on their impact, lead time, and frequency of occurrence:

    Unanticipated catastrophes. These are historically remarkable events that can’t be anticipated and lead to trillions of dollars in losses. Examples include extreme terrorism and a systemic cyberattack.
    Foreseeable catastrophes. Shocks in this category are of a similar magnitude to an unanticipated catastrophe but differ in that larger patterns and probabilities can guide general preparedness. Examples include financial crises and global military conflicts.
    Unanticipated disruptions. These are serious and costly events but are on a smaller scale than catastrophes. Examples include data breaches, product recalls, and industrial accidents.
    Foreseeable disruptions. Some disruptions can be spotted in advance of their arrival. Examples include China–US trade disputes and the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.

Organizations often focus on managing the shocks that they see most often. The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that while outliers are rare, organizations still need to consider such possibilities when making decisions and strategic moves. For most organizations, that will mean expanding supply chain executives’ long-standing focus on cost (and capital usage), service, and quality to include three new priorities: resilience, agility, and sustainability.
How does inflation affect supply chains?

Inflation can play a role in supply chain challenges. When inflation occurs, costs for input materials (such as energy) can rise substantially, having negative effects on companies’ profits and losses. One way to adjust is to increase prices (fairly) for consumers. Organizations can make more informed decisions by using an exposure matrix to assesses which categories of their products are exposed to market forces and whether the market is inflating or deflating. Also, organizations aren’t necessarily at the mercy of suppliers that say they have to increase prices in an inflationary market; McKinsey has identified several strategies for negotiating such demands.
What is supply chain resilience?

Resilience refers to the ability to withstand, adapt, and thrive in the face of internal and external shocks—both known and unknown. More specifically, operational resilience, which encompasses supply chains, is about businesses maintaining robust production capacity that can accommodate shifts in demand and remain stable amid disruption, without letting quality slide.

When it comes to supply chain management, there are three steps that organizations can take to account for long-term uncertainty and possible upheaval:

    Firefighting. This refers to short-term, day-to-day actions that can help identify previously overlooked supply chain gaps. These tactics don’t build resilience, however, so they should be used only in concert with more complex, long-term reforms.
    Integrating and streamlining operations. Here, three actions can be critical to building resilient supply chains:
        creating a nerve center to consolidate organizational responses
        simulating and planning for extreme supply and demand disruptions
        reevaluating just-in-time inventory strategies
    Achieving structural resilience. Quick responses are easier to accomplish, but if long-term resilience is the goal, the following techniques can help:
        constructing a digital twin of the most critical parts of the supply chain, allowing for simulations and test cases
        creating and testing “what if” scenarios
        increasing data sharing with suppliers
        considering ring-fencing a small part of the supply chain team

Other factors, such as building transparency for multiple tiers of suppliers, will be crucial vis-à-vis supply chain risk management. To take just one example, tapping into digital tools, building skills, and getting clear on processes helped an aerospace player that looked to increase its supply chain resilience.
How do great supply chain organizations work?

Supply chain management (and operations, more broadly) is now a CEO-level concern. Some of the strategic operational questions that CEOs have on their agenda include the following:

    Can we meet customer demand both today and tomorrow?
    Should we boost capacity to prepare for prolonged, rapid growth or reduce it to prepare for a slowdown?
    Where will we find workers who are skilled and digitally savvy?
    How do we decarbonize, minimize regulatory risk, and stay in business?

Incremental efforts aren’t enough to capture the full potential, and drilling down in the right supply chain structure and physical footprints is a critical starting point. While it will take time to adapt supply or value chains (given challenges related to finding and qualifying alternative suppliers and to building new plants), taking a fresh look at networks and supply chain structures can help companies move forward.

Here’s an example from the automotive industry. McKinsey research uncovered that midsize supplier plants with 1,000 to 1,500 employees were nearly twice as likely as bigger or smaller counterparts to score in the top quartile on productivity. So having production divided among several plants rather than in a single megafactory could help a company move closer to customers and reduce location risks (for example, weather-induced closures).

Choices about supply chain design won’t work miracles. There’s no correlation, in McKinsey research, between supply chain organizational archetypes and bottom-line performance. But a variety of organizational mechanisms can supplement structure and help lead to successful outcomes. A survey found six markers of great supply chain teams, all of which were correlated with improved EBITDA:

    end-to-end coordination
    decision rights
    performance metrics
    social cohesion
    career mobility
    capability growth

What about digital supply chains?

Few established companies have fully digitized their end-to-end operations. But digitization can be a feasible solution to operational challenges seen across many companies and industries. Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), describes the impact that increased connectivity, automation, and more have had on technology, industry, and society. In a survey of more than 400 global manufacturers, more than 90 percent of respondents said Industry 4.0 has helped them sustain their operations during the COVID-19 crisis; over half said their digital transformations have been crucial to their pandemic responses.

Digitization, including advanced analytics, automation, and machine learning, can help operations become more productive, flexible, and geared for speed. Such approaches have yielded real results for some leading organizations—for example, reducing inventory and cost of goods sold by 30 percent, lowering cost of quality by 50 percent, and improving cash and productivity by 30 percent. Surveys also suggest that digitization and an embrace of Industry 4.0 technologies can boost eco-efficiency in supply chains.

While some leading organizations have already realized value from digitization, others are lagging behind. Modernizing supply chain IT—for instance, to improve demand forecasting and planning systems—can have a powerful effect. For organizations looking to step up on IT for supply chain planning, three steps can help:

    Redesign processes.
    Select vendors.
    Create an implementation road map.

Cumulatively, these changes can have a significant impact, especially when they support a successful rollout of integrated business planning (IBP). Compared with organizations that lack a well-functioning IBP process, the average mature IBP practitioner realizes one or two additional percentage points in EBIT. Service levels are five to 20 percentage points higher. Freight costs and capital intensity are 10 to 15 percent lower, and customer delivery penalties and missed sales are 40 to 50 percent lower. IBP technology and process discipline can also make planners 10 to 20 percent more productive.

An interview with Kimberly-Clark chief supply chain officer Shane Azzi underscores the importance of digital tools in supply chains. “Like many companies, we don’t always have the full picture,” Azzi said. “That’s why digital becomes such an important part of the solution—because you’ve got to have that end-to-end picture. We must be able to see emerging risks further upstream and downstream than ever before.” To get there, the company has explored demand sensing, looked at suppliers’ production schedules and logistics plans, and used digital platforms to monitor in-transit shipments.
How does a supply chain affect sustainability?

Managing an operation’s environmental impact holistically can help in addressing environmental, social, and governance issues more broadly. And the first step is often to understand the potential impact of driving eco-efficiency.

Manufacturers in the Global Lighthouse Network (GLN), a collaborative initiative by McKinsey and World Economic Forum, that have embraced digital transformation have found that sustainability and competitive excellence may well go hand in hand. GLN data collected since the beginning of the project indicate that upward of 60 percent of “lighthouse” factories saw sustainability impact as part of the effect enabled by Industry 4.0 transformations. And that research highlighted three sustainability-focused manufacturing leaders based on their commitment to environment sustainability: Ericsson, Henkel, and Schneider Electric.

Within supply or value chains, resource cleansheeting can help in designing cost-effective, carbon abated products. Designers, engineers, and purchasers could use this approach to identify factors that affect costs and emissions for a given product or service along the entire value stream and throughout its life cycle.

More broadly, a number of companies are thinking about how to decarbonize their supply chains, focusing on Scope 3 emissions—that is, emissions generated up- and downstream in the value chain. This category of emissions can account for 80 percent of many companies’ overall climate impact. Consider the results that Interface, a carpet manufacturer in Europe, has seen since setting its mission-zero target in the early 1990s: it has since reduced its operations’ greenhouse-gas footprint by 96 percent and cut the carbon intensity of its products by 69 percent.

Consumer goods companies in particular are making strides in preparing for a sustainable future by transforming company operations across the entire supply chain. Henkel, a consumer goods company based in Germany, provides one example of how a sustainability focus can flow through a supply chain. In an interview, the chief supply chain officer for Henkel’s laundry and home care business describes how the division decreased its CO2 footprint by 65 percent in the past 15 years, improving operational performance at the same time it lowered costs and CO2 emissions.
Supply Planning: Definition, Process, and Best Practices
Supply planning is a business management tool that impacts supply, demand, and inventory levels. Retailers use supply chain planning systems to provide projected demand for products and materials needed to support those demands. 

The process is designed to balance plans for future demand with the availability of goods in inventory. Supply planning helps companies determine how much product they need to keep in stock. Order entry, review and release of orders with suppliers, and inventory management within warehouses and distribution channels are all factors that inform the supply planning function and help companies meet supply chain planning objectives.

The lead times for supplier products to be received, the complexity of managing multiple vendors, the need for material handling equipment, and the availability of labor complicate the process. Let’s take an in-depth look at the supply chain planning process, the supply chain planning method, and its best practices. This article will explore supply chain planning functions and help to quell your forecasting and inventory concerns.
What Is Supply Planning?

Supply planning is a process that involves analyzing demand forecasts, comparing the forecasted demand to existing inventory, and coordinating the supply chain activities needed to meet that demand. It determines the production level of goods or services, the materials that are required, and when they must be acquired. 

Supply planning, also known as raw material or material planning or allocation planning, is often the cornerstone of optimized supply chain management. A supply chain planning strategy is designed to ensure that the right product is available at the right place and time while minimizing costs and risks associated with the supply chain. Inventory levels are intended to meet projected sales volume. This all helps to ensure customer satisfaction.

Inventory management is vital to sales and operations planning because it affects sales volume and product pricing. The inventory levels are adjusted as demand volumes change. When there is a change in demand, there must be a production adjustment to align with the change, which may require companies to adjust inventory levels. 

Changes in sales volume directly affect inventory levels. Stores must control their inventories to meet customer demand. Doing these processes well can result in higher sales because inventory is available for customers when they want to make a purchase. They can support their companies by increasing sales and reducing costs by having the right amount of products on hand. 
The Supply Planning Process

The supply chain planning process involves coordinating the movement of goods, from raw materials to finished products, in a supply chain. Here are the steps in the supply planning process.
Forecast Demand

Forecasting demand for products is the first step in the process. It involves analyzing historical sales data and market trends to predict the level of product demand in the future. It is important to develop these forecasts regularly because there are many external factors – such as inflation or the inability to get raw materials due to trade sanctions – that could impact sales of your products. These potential disruptions must be considered when planning for future inventory requirements to support an efficient supply chain.

Demand can be determined by analyzing sales levels, historical data, customer surveys, and past trends. The forecast relies on sales forecasts because they show how market demand will change over the product’s life. 

Depending on the type of product you are selling, you must also project custom orders. You can project the custom order from various sources, and each custom order should be considered a separate demand element rather than a single lump sum for each item in the sale. It’s more efficient to handle your customers as individual buyers.
Determine Sources of Supply

Once the forecast demand is known, the next step is identifying the sources required to meet that demand. This process includes identifying suppliers, negotiating contracts, and establishing inventory levels.

For retail stores, this step involves identifying the supplier’s location and establishing a contract to buy products. For consumer goods producers, this step would include finding suppliers to provide raw materials for their production process. 

With this step, you may also identify changes in payment terms, such as requiring immediate payment or accepting open account credit terms with your suppliers. Your objective is to set up a supply plan that supports your business strategy while managing cash flow and working within your company’s budget allocations.
Schedule Production

Based on the forecast demand and the sources of supply, the company creates a production schedule based on the availability of goods necessary for production. Scheduling production affects the order of the usage of raw materials and the manufacture of finished products. 

It involves setting up production schedules to meet demand and coordinating with suppliers to schedule plant production runs. For example, a manufacturer may set up a production schedule based on raw material and labor availability, known as manufacturing resource planning (MRP). MRP is a computerized system that schedules resources to meet demand.
Plan Transportation

Plan the transportation of goods from the supplier to the manufacturer and from the manufacturer to the customer. This requires selecting carriers, coordinating with multiple carriers, and determining the most efficient modes and routes to get the product where it needs to be when it needs to be there.
Manage Inventory

Inventory management involves allocating space and other containers required for storing materials in a distribution center. It determines the optimal inventory levels to maintain for production schedules’

A key component of inventory planning is understanding what drives demand for an item. Inventory monitoring is automated to identify trends in the market, order patterns, and sales history. This information determines how much product should be acquired to have sufficient supplies before selling at the optimum price.
Monitor and Adjust the Plan

The supply chain management planning process is ongoing, and the plan may need to be adjusted as market conditions change or new information becomes available. Regularly review and update the supply plan to ensure that it remains effective.
Why Supply Planning Matters

different types of rolls organized in a warehouse

Supply planning is a vital function to ensure a company has enough raw materials to meet production demands. If a company lacks enough raw materials, it can lead to production delays, which can be costly and disrupt the smooth operation of the business. 

On the other hand, if a company has too much raw materials inventory, it can tie up valuable financial resources that can boost other sectors elsewhere in the business. Proper supply planning is, therefore, essential for maintaining an efficient and cost-effective production process.

An adequate supply plan helps a company strike the right balance between these extremes. It ensures enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing excess inventory and associated costs. 

A supply plan is the foundation of a company’s entire supply chain, including coordinating the procurement of raw materials and scheduling production. The effectiveness of the supply chain can impact a company’s profitability and its level of customer service.
Supply Planning Best Practices

Through continuous improvement efforts, supply chain planners work to improve sales and operations planning performance. Here are a few best practices to consider when planning your global supply chains.
Collaborate With Suppliers

Establish strong relationships with your suppliers and work with them to ensure a consistent and reliable flow of goods. To communicate with suppliers effectively, you should use a single system to request, track, and manage all customer requests.
Use Technology to Improve Supply Planning

Use technology to support and improve the supply plan. You can use various software applications, such as inventory management systems or sales forecasting software, to track inventory levels, delivery schedules, and other key performance metrics.
Implement Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting involves assessing market trends to determine the anticipated level of demand for your product. It helps set production volumes, track product introduction schedules, and plan for future on-hand inventory levels. Use real-time data and analytics to anticipate demand and plan accordingly to help avoid shortages or overstocking.
Build Flexibility Into Your Supply Chain

While the supply chain is your customer’s lifeline to product availability, you must ensure it is flexible enough to meet changing needs. The components of your supply chain should include various elements that enable production in different quantities at different locations. 

You also need the flexibility to adjust production timing or manufacturing schedules when conditions warrant. Consider implementing multiple sources of supply and incorporating flexible manufacturing approaches to reduce the impact of disruptions.
FAQs

Here are frequently asked questions regarding supply planning and supply chain processes.
What is the purpose of supply planning?

Supply planning provides a framework for managing supply and demand in your company. The supply plan is designed to identify the most cost-effective and efficient methods for acquiring, stocking, and distributing raw materials, components, and finished goods. You may experience shortages or overstock and incur excess costs without proper supply planning.
What is demand planning vs. supply planning? 

Demand planning is forecasting the future demand for a company’s products or services and determining how much of those products or services the company will need to produce to meet that demand. Supply planning involves how to source, manufacture, and distribute the necessary products to meet the demand forecasted by the demand planning process.
Final Thoughts

The supply planning process is a critical component of effective logistics. Supply chain planning involves anticipating future demand and planning the most efficient methods of acquiring and distributing raw materials or finished goods. It ensures a timely supply of materials and finished goods.
Inventory management is the act of ordering, tracking, storing and selling inventory across the entire supply chain. It’s essential if you want the right mix of products available to sell to your customers. There are many inventory management techniques that help you better manage your inventory and run a more profitable business. In this article, we discuss the top 17 techniques.
What Is Inventory Management?

Inventory management is a supply chain function that tracks inventory from the manufacturer to point-of-sale. This includes forecasting demand, procuring raw materials or finished products, storing inventory, tracking sales and then reordering when inventory levels are low. The goal of inventory management is to ensure you have enough product to meet demand while reducing costs associated with your inventory.
Why Is Inventory Management Important?

Effective inventory management is important because it can help increase revenue, reduce cost and improve customer service. Specifically, inventory management is important due to the following reasons:

    Increases Revenue: Effective inventory management ensures that you have the right products on hand at all times, allowing you to meet customer demand. This helps you avoid supply shortages that can eat into revenue.
    Reduces Cost: The longer you hold inventory, the more it costs due to holding costs, handling costs and costs resulting from obsolete or spoiled inventory. Effective inventory management reduces these costs by minimizing the inventory you hold.
    Improves Customer Service: Having the right inventory to meet customer demand results in happier customers with fewer frustrations.

The benefits of inventory management are numerous. If you do it right, you’ll be able to increase sales, lower costs and better serve your customers. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the top inventory management techniques to help you manage your inventory more effectively.
Essential Inventory Management Techniques

There are many inventory management techniques, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. When choosing the best techniques for you, make sure to consider the type of product you sell, the size of your business, your overall budget and the level of accuracy needed to run an effective supply chain.

Here are the top 17 inventory management techniques and why they’re important:
1. Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting is the act of accurately predicting future demand for your products and is something every business should do. If you forecast demand well, you ensure that you’ll have the right amount of inventory on hand to meet customer demand.

Some of the top ways to forecast your demand include a moving average, exponential smoothing, time series analysis and judgmental forecasting. The right technique will depend on your unique business. Regardless of the technique you choose, it’s important to note that demand forecasting will never be exact, which may lead to stockouts or overstocks.
2. ABC Analysis

ABC analysis is an inventory management technique that ranks inventory items based on their importance to your business. This is most helpful when a business needs to prioritize which items to order and store, allowing for more oversight on certain inventory items. When conducting an ABC analysis, divide your inventory into three categories:

    A Items: The most important items that account for 20% of the inventory items but up to 80% of the inventory value.
    B Items: Items with medium importance to the business that account for 30% of the inventory items and roughly 15% of the inventory value.
    C Items: The least important items that account for 50% of the inventory items but only around 5% of the inventory value.

3. Safety Stock

Safety stock represents the amount of extra inventory you keep on hand to cover unexpected demand or delays in future deliveries. Safety stock is important if you want to avoid stockouts. Safety stock is determined based on demand variability, delivery lead time, the cost of stockouts and the cost of holding inventory.
4. Reorder Points

Reorder points represent the inventory levels at which new orders should be placed. Reorder points are specific to individual inventory items and are based on that item’s average daily usage, order lead time and the amount of safety stock you have on hand. Reorder points are an essential part of inventory management and help you avoid stockouts.
5. PAR Levels

Periodic automatic replenishment (PAR) levels track the minimum and maximum levels of inventory maintained for an inventory item. When inventory quantity reaches the minimum level, a new order should be placed. However, inventory shouldn’t exceed the maximum level.

Implementing the PAR levels inventory management technique can therefore avoid both stockouts and overstocking and is best for businesses with perishable items, such as restaurants. PAR levels are based on an item’s average daily demand, lead time and amount of safety stock.
6. Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory

Just-in-time (JIT) inventory is a management method that reduces the amount of inventory you have on hand by only ordering and delivering products at the exact time you need them. To do so, you’ll need to closely track inventory levels and work closely with suppliers. While JIT can reduce inventory costs, it can also result in stockouts and isn’t suitable for all businesses.
7. Dropshipping

Dropshipping is an inventory management technique that doesn’t require the seller to keep inventory items in stock. Instead, the seller works with a third-party supplier who ships the product directly to the customer when a purchase is placed.

This is most popular with online businesses and is great for reducing inventory costs and upfront investments, but gives the seller less control and can also result in lower margins depending on the dropshipping fees.
8. Cross-Docking

Cross-docking is the act of receiving inventory from suppliers and then immediately shipping those products to customers without spending time in a warehouse. This technique can reduce handling and holding costs while improving fulfillment times, and is most commonly used for perishable products. However, it requires a lot of coordination with your suppliers and isn’t a good fit for companies selling non-perishable products or products with low turnover.
9. Inventory Management Software

Inventory management software is a supply chain management tool that helps you track inventory levels, forecast demand and place orders based on current levels. The best inventory management software will depend on your specific business needs but is something everyone should consider using since it helps increase efficiencies and reduce costs.
10. FIFO and LIFO

First in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO) are two inventory management methods that dictate which inventory is sold first and why. With FIFO, you sell the oldest inventory first, while with LIFO, you sell the newest inventory first.

The FIFO method is most common when you’re selling perishable goods that may go bad quickly. The LIFO method is most commonly used in industries where the cost of inventory rises over time, since it can better match costs with revenues and also help defer taxes.
11. Consignment Inventory

Consignment inventory is a technique where a supplier—known as the consignor—gives goods to a retail business—known as a consignee—but retains ownership of the goods until they’re actually sold. The benefit is that the consignee doesn’t actually pay for the goods until they’re sold and the consignor is responsible for shipping costs.

However, the consignee has to cover any holding costs and is responsible for selling the products, which means they can lose money if they don’t sell.
12. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

Economic order quantity (EOQ) is an inventory management technique that helps determine the optimal order quantity for a product that minimizes total inventory costs. EOQ is a calculation that takes into account the annual demand, ordering cost and holding cost of a specific product to arrive at the optimal quantity. This technique reduces cost while also ensuring there is enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand.
13. Perpetual Inventory Management

Perpetual inventory management is the act of continuously updating inventory levels as products are sold or received. Perpetual inventory management provides the most accurate view of inventory levels, improves inventory turnover and avoids inventory stockouts.

However, it can be more time-consuming, expensive and complex than other inventory management techniques, such as periodic inventory management. With the periodic technique, inventory levels are only updated periodically rather than continuously.
14. Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)

Minimum order quantity (MOQ) sets the minimum number of inventory that must be ordered from a supplier at one time. MOQs are typically set by the supplier so they can reduce costs associated with shipping inventory. While beneficial to the supplier, it reduces the ordering flexibility of sellers and can increase costs if you need to order more than you need.
15. Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma

Six Sigma is an inventory management methodology that focuses on reducing variations and defects in your inventory management process. With Six Sigma, you use data-driven methods such as statistical analysis to identify and remove issues in your process. For example, you might use it to better track and manage inventory levels.

Lean Six Sigma combines the Six Sigma methodology with lean manufacturing to increase efficiencies within your inventory management process. For example, you may use it to streamline your process by eliminating unnecessary steps.
16. Bulk Shipping

Bulk shipping is the act of purchasing and shipping inventory in large quantities. This helps reduce shipping costs and can also result in discounts from suppliers. However, bulk shipping can result in overstocking and is potentially harmful if you’re selling perishable items.
17. Batch Tracking

Batch tracking is an inventory management technique that helps businesses track groups of similar items throughout the supply chain. Batch tracking is most commonly used for perishable inventory items as well as items that can be recalled.

Businesses using batch tracking will typically use barcodes or RFID tags to track items. This especially helps with quality control and compliance for items with an expiration date.
Bottom Line

Effective inventory management is crucial for any business that buys and sells goods. There are many inventory management techniques that can help you increase revenues, reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Ultimately, the best techniques depend on your specific business. It’s important to test various techniques to find the best combination for you.

Definition and purpose of procurement.

Procurement is the process by which organizations source and acquire the goods and services they need to operate. It involves everything from identifying needs, sourcing suppliers, negotiating prices, and ensuring timely delivery. But it’s not just about buying stuff; it’s about making sure you’re getting the best value, building strong supplier relationships, and aligning purchases with business objectives.

Want a deep dive? Check out our dedicated article on the definition of procurement for all the nitty-gritty details.
Key activities involved in procurement.

    Need Identification:

    Before any purchases are made, it’s crucial to determine what the organization requires. This could be in response to a shortage, a new project, or regular operational needs.
    Supplier Research:

    Once you know what you need, it’s time to find out who can provide it. This involves researching and evaluating potential suppliers based on factors like price, quality, reliability, and reputation.
    Supplier Negotiation:

    This step involves hashing out the terms of the purchase, from price and quantity to delivery timelines and payment terms.
    Purchase Order Issuance:

    After negotiations, a formal document, known as a purchase order (PO), is issued to the supplier, detailing the specifics of what’s being bought.
    Delivery and Inspection:

    Once the goods or services arrive, they are inspected to ensure they meet the stipulated requirements and quality standards.
    Invoice Processing and Payment:

    After confirming the delivery and quality of goods or services, the procurement team processes the supplier’s invoice and ensures timely payment.
    Supplier Relationship Management:

    Procurement isn’t a one-off activity. Maintaining healthy, long-term relationships with suppliers can lead to better terms, discounts, and improved collaboration in the future.
    Contract Management:

    For longer-term or larger-scale purchases, managing contracts becomes essential. This involves monitoring contract performance, ensuring compliance, and renegotiating terms as necessary.
    Risk Management:

    This is about anticipating potential problems, like supply chain disruptions, and putting measures in place to mitigate them.
    Review and Analysis:

    Regularly analyzing procurement processes can uncover inefficiencies, saving the organization time and money. This could involve reviewing supplier performance, assessing the effectiveness of internal processes, or looking for cost-saving opportunities.

These activities ensure that procurement isn’t just about buying things but is a strategic function that aligns with an organization’s broader goals and objectives.
Role of procurement in an organization.

    Strategic Sourcing:

    Procurement is not just about buying; it’s about acquiring the right goods and services at the best value. Strategic sourcing ensures that purchases align with the organization’s overall objectives and goals.
    Cost Savings:

    By negotiating favorable terms, taking advantage of discounts, and streamlining operations, procurement can significantly reduce costs and contribute to the financial health of an organization.
    Risk Management:

    Procurement teams anticipate and manage risks, from supply chain disruptions to geopolitical events, ensuring that the organization remains resilient and agile.
    Supplier Relationship Management:

    Building and maintaining healthy relationships with suppliers can lead to better collaboration, improved terms, and innovations that benefit both parties.
    Sustainability and Ethical Practices:

supply chain management vs logistics

There are plenty of similarities between supply chain management (SCM) and logistics, but there are key differences that separate the two practices. Understanding the role each plays can help companies make operational improvements, enhance customer service and build a competitive advantage.

In this article:

    Similarities between Supply Chain Management and Logistics
    How Supply Chain Management and Logistics Are Different
    Logistical Components of the Supply Chain
    How to Streamline Supply Chain Management with Logistics

What Are Supply Chain Logistics?

Supply chain logistics coordinate the storage and shipping of goods and services across the supply chain. The practice begins with raw materials, continues on to manufacturing and/or distribution and ends when a business delivers finished goods to the customer or when products are returned to their final destination.

Key Takeaways

    While many use supply chain management and logistics interchangeably, they cover different (but related) activities.
    A supply chain covers the production and delivery of goods and services to all types of customers.
    When well executed, both supply chain management and logistics can give companies a competitive advantage and bring value to customers.

Are Logistics and Supply Chain Management the Same Thing?

Logistics focuses on the movement and storage of items in the supply chain. Supply chain management (SCM) is more comprehensive, covering all of the coordination between partners that have a role in this network, including sourcing, manufacturing, transporting, storing and selling. The ultimate goal of SCM is to find processes that ensure a smooth, efficient flow of goods that give customers an excellent experience and drive the business forward.

While supply chain management handles activities between separate entities, logistics focuses on the internal movement of goods. Additionally, SCM supports all purchasing, production and distribution of goods. Logistics, meanwhile, moves and stores goods between different points in the supply chain. To learn more, read our article on inbound and outbound logistics.
Supply Chain Management vs. Logistics

SCM includes the high-level processes involved in sourcing and buying raw materials and eventually creating finished goods. SCM uses logistics to deliver goods to the consumer, but it ultimately strives to boost the bottom line and increase a business’s competitive edge.

In other words, SCM sets the strategy and directs daily logistical activities that happen in factories, warehouses, local shipping centers and other facilities. Logistics is an aspect of the supply chain that stores or delivers finished goods or services to the customer, whether that’s a manufacturer, distributor or consumer. The goal of logistics is to get goods and services to the customer on time and at a competitive price. Learn more in our introductory logistics guide.
What Is Supply Chain Management?

Supply chain management refers to the activities that create finished goods from raw materials and deliver them to the customer. SCM also focuses on improving supply chain processes, which can benefit both customers and business partners.

A company can only optimize and continuously refine SCM when it has visibility across its supply chain. This visibility enables companies to track goods and services as they move through each stage of the supply chain, which makes it much easier to see if everything is running as planned. It also gives decision-makers more time to respond to disruptions or other roadblocks.

SCM involves overseeing an often-vast network of sub-suppliers (like raw materials providers), suppliers, manufacturers, logistics partners, wholesale distributors, retailers and end users. The relationships between these various stakeholders in the supply chain vary. They can be vertical, such as between parts and materials suppliers, manufacturers and retailers, or horizontal, where a company merges with or acquires a similar business that operates at the same stage of the supply chain.

To illustrate how supply chain management works, let’s use a home cleaning products manufacturer as an example. As part of the SCM function, the company sources the chemicals and containers it needs from suppliers, makes the end product and then distributes the finished goods to convenience stores, drug stores and supermarkets. Supply chain management touches on every process involved in the movement of those products.
What Are Logistics?

Logistics includes planning and executing the storage and movement of goods between different points in the supply chain. Logistics coordinates facilities, people, equipment and other resources to ensure products move when they’re supposed to and there is space for them at the next stop.

Demand planning, transportation (including fleet management), inventory management, material handling and order fulfillment are all processes that fall under logistics. To learn more, read our article on logistics management.
How Are Supply Chain Management and Logistics the Same?

Both supply chain management and logistics focus on the flow of goods from the point of origin to the endpoint. Both disciplines require careful coordination of supplies, labor and facilities to make sure items can move through the supply chain as required. Logistics is a key component of supply chain management, but just one piece of the equation.
Similarities of Supply Chain Management and Logistics

Supply chain management and logistics both work to move, store and deliver goods as efficiently as possible. Supply chain management provides the strategic direction that guides inbound and outbound logistics.
Some common aspects of SCM and logistics are:

    Both focus on goods, services or information.
    Both have the ultimate aim of supporting the company’s success and distinguishing it from competitors.
    Both seek to increase customer satisfaction.
    Both revolve around the same flow of goods and services, from the supplier, to the manufacturer, to the wholesaler and finally to the retailer or consumer.

How Are Supply Chain Management and Logistics Different?

Supply chain management outlines the strategy and activities that go into planning, sourcing, producing and delivering goods, as well as handling returns. Logistics focuses on the right products being in the right place at the right time, and how to get them there.
Key Differences Between Supply Chain Management and Logistics

As should be clear at this point, supply chain management and logistics definitely intersect, but they differ when it comes to their scope and focus.
Key differences between SCM and logistics include:

    Logistics are activities in supply chain management. SCM covers a variety of activities, including production and inventory planning, labor planning, materials and facilities management, manufacturing and delivering goods and services.
    SCM works toward improving processes to create competitive advantages, while logistics emphasizes meeting customer needs and expectations.
    Logistics focus on the efficient and cost-effective delivery of goods to the customer.
    Supply chain management controls the development of raw materials into finished goods that move from the supplier to producer to warehouse to retailers and/or consumers.
    The term logistics originated with the military. Many historians credit Alexander the Great, born 356 B.C., as a logistics master.
    The modern practice of supply chain management started in the 20th century. Many experts credit the logistician Keith Oliver as the person who coined the term supply chain management in the early 1980s.

Role of Logistics in Supply Chain Management

In supply chain management, logistics are responsible for the movement and storage of goods and services, along with the documents and reports that record those movements throughout an item’s journey to the customer.

Logistics include the numerous transportation methods that get inventory from one location to another. This component is responsible for figuring out where goods can be kept at each stage until they’re needed at another location, which is essential to effective supply chain management.
Why Logistics Are So Important to Supply Chains

Logistics are a critical piece of supply chains because it manages and tracks the people and resources needed to store and transfer goods and services. Logistics ensure that materials and products reliably move at the right time and on budget.

Specific aspects of logistics that support supply chains include:

    Delivering the right products at the right time.
    Reducing costs and improving efficiency.
    Helping retain customers and increasing loyalty.
    Providing a unique value proposition for some businesses.
    Providing a means to deliver goods from the most cost-effective location for production to the location of the customer.

Why Is Logistics Training So Important to Supply Chains?

The field of logistics is constantly evolving as customer trends change. Logistics training helps employees and their companies stay current with best practices. Training gives a company the tools it needs to analyze and improve customer demand, product design and distribution strategies.

Why Use Logistics and Supply Chain Management?

Logistics and supply chain management help businesses stay competitive. These practices track and coordinate the efficient and cost-effective movement of goods and services, which is key to an organization’s profitability.
Logistical Components of the Supply Chain

Supply chain logistical components help to manage goods or services. Each element helps move materials, finished goods and services through the many steps in the supply chain.
The following are the logistical components of supply chains:

    Information:

    Information helps track the status of items and all supply chain processes, informing business decisions at each step.
    Storage:

    Storage is the practice of holding supplies in the right quantity and right location. Businesses must strike a balance between demand and supply to prevent overstock and out-of-stock situations.
    Warehousing:

    This component controls the day-to-day warehouse operations, such as receiving, put-away, picking, packing, shipping and receiving.
    Material handling:

    Material handling can refer to the limited movement of items within a building or a delivery vehicle. Others extend the definition to include the storage, security and transfer of goods throughout the manufacturing, distribution and delivery processes.
    Packaging:

    Proper packaging ensures items arrive undamaged and ship for the lowest possible cost.
    Unitization:

    Unitization makes items efficient to arrange, transport and store. Unitization methods also ensure that material handling equipment can move items efficiently and without damaging them. The cube is one of the easiest units to store and shift, so it’s a popular type of unitization.
    Inventory control:

    Inventory control incorporates storage and warehousing techniques to optimize the types and amount of stock held and where. Companies can use inventory management formulas to better calculate demand.
    Transportation:

    This component is responsible for moving goods along the supply chain to the next node or directly to the customer. Transportation modes include cars, trains, trucks, planes and ships.

How Both Supply Chain Management and Logistics Are Fundamental to Success

Supply chain management and logistics both support customer needs and improve the buying experience. Logistics provides direct feedback on customer demand. SCM uses this data to understand what consumers want and plan production and inventory levels.

Reliable, cost-effective logistics pave the way to efficient supply chain management. A well-managed supply chain results in filling orders accurately and on time, which over time will attract new clients and grow the bottom line.

Many businesses have realized the benefits of using supply chain management software to help mitigate the complexities and challenges of supply chains. This software can unify various aspects of the supply chain, from sourcing to production planning to inventory and order management, to help organizations meet rising customer expectations while keeping costs stable. It can also provide in-depth reporting on various aspects of your operations to highlight opportunities for process improvements or call attention to potential problems.

One company transformed its business after adapting supply chain management software. Initially a candy company, Green Rabbit built a heat-sensitive supply chain to help preserve its products during shipment. Other companies took notice, began to pay for the service, and Green Rabbit became a leading cold-chain logistics provider for perishable goods. Green Rabbit implemented NetSuite to manage its growing business, which includes three warehouses and an expanding list of customers. The solution automated many processes and it can now ship orders to all customers in one day.
Supply chain management (SCM) came into sharp focus years ago when the cherry red paint for Corvettes, sourced from a single supplier in Japan, suddenly became unavailable. An earthquake had disrupted the production center, causing short-term supply issues and exposing the risks of a single-point-of-failure supply chain.

Virtually every product we use comes to us through a supply chain. Whether we buy a new cell phone or order a prescription, there’s a complex set of steps the items go through to arrive at our doorstep.

 
What Is Supply Chain Management?

Supply chain management involves overseeing and optimizing steps, including:

    Forecasting product demand
    Sourcing raw supplies from suppliers
    Authorizing supplier payments
    Manufacturing products
    Warehousing products
    Controlling inventory management
    Handling risk management
    Transporting products to various locations (such as distributors, retailers, and end users)
    Logistics management (i.e., managing the logistics of returned products)

 
Why Is Global Supply Chain Management Important?

An effective supply chain management process helps ensure that vital products arrive at the right place at the right time. Synchronizing these steps in an efficient manner is a big part of what keeps the global supply chain and the economy going.

Modern business operations rely on smooth supply chain management to help them adapt to shifting market dynamics and meet customer demands for quick delivery. Supply chain transparency provides insights that help organizations to manage inventory levels, eliminate waste, and reduce transportation costs. Using a variety of supply chain management tools, professionals can answer questions such as:

    What new products are customers demanding?
    How can we reduce warehousing time and deliver goods to customers faster?
    Which products are sitting in the warehouse and need new pricing strategies?
    Are we scheduling deliveries according to the most efficient routes?
    What are our vulnerabilities to interruptions in the supply chain?

 
Gaining a Competitive Edge with Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management is important for helping to improve customer satisfaction. The managers of supply chains serve a critical role in an organization, developing strategies to ensure each step along the way is as efficient as possible.

They oversee each supply chain activity, ranging from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to end customers and improving logistics management. All of these steps help to maximize customer satisfaction and improve operational efficiency.

Supply chain professionals are consummate problem solvers. Using data from the entire business to guide their decisions, they foresee and resolve potential impediments to keep business operations running smoothly.

 
Supply Chain Management in the Military

Military supply chains are huge and global. They support everything from basic needs such as food, water, and clothing to highly specialized equipment such as fighter jets, satellites, and cybersecurity tools.

“Military supply chains must operate in peace, crisis, and war – often with extreme precision in harsh or unpredictable environments,” says Dr. Robert Lee Gordon, the Department Chair of Analytics, Economics, and Finance at American Military University. “Unlike civilian supply chains, military logistics information – such as routes, inventory, and suppliers – must be protected. Managing secure supply chains, encrypting logistics data, and vetting suppliers are critical tasks.”

 
Typical Career Opportunities in Supply Chain Management

Pursuing a career path in supply chain management may be ideal for people with an analytical mind, strong interpersonal skills, and an interest in making sense of complex problems. There are many industries where supply chain management is needed, including:

    Manufacturing
    Healthcare
    Retail
    Food and beverage

The Benefits of Supply Chain Roles

For supply chain professionals, there are many exciting aspects of the job, such as:

    Using the latest technology
    Making a difference in people’s lives
    Building connections around the world

 
Using the Latest Technology

Complex supply chains require various technical solutions to gain insight into how the organization is performing against its supply chain strategy. Because of the need for visibility and mechanization, supply chain managers gain exposure to the latest supply chain technology, including:

    Robotics to automate many warehouse tasks
    Augmented reality for training staff
    3D printing to create different components
    Digital twins (a digital representation of a physical object for simulating different business scenarios)
    Machine learning to optimize supply chain operations

Supply chain solutions use mathematical models and machine learning to make data-driven decisions that streamline supply chain activities. With technology, organizations can more quickly make informed decisions about supply chain management-related issues, such as stocking levels, staffing levels, and shipping activities.
Making a Difference in People’s Lives

Supply chain activities aren’t just about making sure consumers get the latest tech gadget or in-style purse. Successful supply chain management is behind the delivery of life-saving medicines to hospitals, emergency goods to disaster sites, and food to underserved communities. For instance, the shortage of IV fluids after Hurricane Helene demonstrated the severe impact that disruptions in the supply chain have on people’s lives.
Building Connections Around the World

Material shortages, regional differences in compliance and regulatory rules, and geopolitical instability are just a few of the supply chain challenges that come with managing a global supply chain. Supply chain professionals work with colleagues and suppliers around the world to keep their supply chain running at optimal performance. They need to be attuned to cultural sensitivities in different countries as well as emerging political issues that may affect production and impact customer and manufacturing demands.

 
Current Challenges in Supply Chain Management

“Organizations must be ready for supply chain disruptions, particularly from tariffs looming over the U.S.,” says Dr. Gordon. “Being prepared and developing contingency plans for shortages or developing alternative vendors is critical at this time. If key items are required for the organization, multiple suppliers will need to be developed to decrease the risk of one supplier causing production delays.”

Dr. Gordon advises using the 80/20 rule. “Whenever an outside supplier provides a key component, it’s best to have two suppliers. One supplier will provide 80% of the required product and the second will provide 20% of the product.”

If one supplier has an issue, increasing orders with a second supplier is easier than building an entirely new production line with a new supplier. Making sure to have options and developing them in advance is a lot better than having to develop a supplier and produce specialized equipment on short notice.

 
How Can Supply Chain Management Professionals Mitigate Risk?

According to the Forbes Business Development Council, organizations with a well-managed supply chain use various strategies to prevent disruptions and improve customer service:

    Vetting suppliers to understand their workplace and ethical sourcing practices
    Diversifying suppliers
    Collaborating with suppliers on problem solving
    Monitoring product quality
    Using 3D printing to create components
    Obtaining guidance from an insurance company specializing in understanding complex supply chains
    Using predictive analytics to respond quickly to market shifts and changes in customer expectations
    Monitoring supplier performance to identify potential vulnerabilities

 
Supply Chain Models

There are numerous supply chain models businesses can use to optimize processes. They include:

    The continuous flow model
    The Agile supply chain model
    The vertical integration model

The Continuous Flow Model

A continuous flow model is appropriate for organizations with high-demand products that require vigilant oversight of their production and distribution. This model helps with predicting demand, reducing lead time, and making processes more consistent.
The Agile Supply Chain Model

An Agile supply chain model is used by enterprises that face uncertainty and unexpected market fluctuations. This type of supply chain model allows for swift responsiveness, greater flexibility in supply sources and shift production, and easier adaption to variabilities.
The Vertical Integration Model

A vertical integration model helps businesses to manage everything from extracting raw materials to supporting product delivery. The goal is to deliver more consistent product quality. This model also helps companies reduce their reliance on outside suppliers, lower costs through economies of scale, and gain more control over production and delivery.

 
What Are Common Supply Chain Activities?

Effective supply chain management involves keeping a close eye on many processes across the entire supply chain, from the initial acquisition of raw goods to distribution of final products and handling of returned products. Supply chain management leaders are always on the lookout for ways to gain a competitive advantage by enhancing manufacturing processes and reducing production costs while exceeding customer expectations.
Raw Material Sourcing

Strategic sourcing helps reduce costs and lower the risk of supply chain problems due to material shortages or transportation delays.
Adapting to Changing Market Needs

Supply chain management involves the ability to adapt to changes in the market. For example supply chain managers must adapt to global chain supply shifts such as political situations, regulatory changes, and evolving customer preferences. They may also deal with unexpected challenges such as natural disasters and pandemics.
Demand Planning and Supply Planning

Demand and supply planning helps businesses to make accurate projections about what their customers want and adapt inventories accordingly. If a business’s demand planning shows a need for a higher volume of products or services, supply planning involves how to adapt manufacturing processes to meet changing market demands.
Inventory Management

Inventory management is necessary to help accelerate the production of goods. This process is complex.

It also involves analyzing trends and ensuring raw materials arrive at the right place and time, in the right quantity and quality, to keep a production process moving forward. Part of inventory management is transporting goods from suppliers to the manufacturing floor and from there to internal warehouses.

If inventory management falls short, that costs the company money and may result in delays in delivery. Inventories are constantly in flux, so supply chain management needs real-time insight into the status of products and services.
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems

An integral part of supply chain management solutions includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This central platform keeps track of everything from the cost of raw goods to the logistics of manufacturing, warehousing, and shipping final products. An ERP system also offers instant transparency into supply chain performance metrics, such as:

    Stock levels of products
    Overstock of goods
    Warehouse costs
    Order accuracy
    Fulfillment rates

ERP systems can also serve to automate routine supply chain processes like invoicing and order completion. Using insights from an enterprise resource planning system, organizations can optimize resource allocation to improve operational efficiency.
Analyzing Costs

In an era of big-box stores and giant e-commerce providers, organizations are under relentless pressure to reduce the costs of their products. Consequently, supply chain managers are often tasked with negotiating supplier contracts and taking advantage of volume discounts. They also use data from enterprise resource planning and other systems to continually analyze the cost of goods and how best to source materials.
Overseeing Production Schedules

Production scheduling sets the sequence and timing of all aspects of manufacturing and production of goods. With a smooth-running production schedule, a business can ensure that it is quickly getting quality products into the hands of customers. Any downtime in the production schedule can cause problems downstream in the manufacturing or delivery process.
Risk Management

There are inherent risks to supply chain operations, ranging from cybersecurity attacks to product shortages to natural disasters. 11% of U.S. enterprises surveyed reported that supply chain disruptions resulted in a loss of more than 20% in annual revenues, according to the research group Economic Intelligence Unit.

Risk management involves a systematic approach to identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. With this information, enterprises can develop mitigation approaches to quickly respond if these threats occur.

 
How Supply Chain Management Supports Sustainability Goals

More than 70% of consumers around the world say sustainability is important in their choice of products, according to a recent report by Simon Kucher. Interestingly, consumers are willing to pay an average of 9.7% more for products that are sourced in a sustainable way.

Making a supply chain more environmentally friendly involves gaining visibility into the environmental footprint of raw materials, manufacturing operations, transportation, and other areas of the supply chain. This investigative endeavor into corporate sustainability may be complex, involving seeking sustainability reports and metrics from suppliers, carriers, and others involved in the supply chain.

There are numerous ways to lower an organization’s carbon footprint and build a more sustainable supply chain. For example, an organization can:

    Reduce transportation emissions, either by making shipping more efficient or engaging carriers who use electric vehicles.
    Make warehouses more environmentally friendly. Everything from the lighting to the concrete floors in the warehouse can be sourced in an eco-friendly manner. Also, consider the source of electricity that runs warehouses and how to connect with green energy suppliers.
    Negotiate contracts with suppliers to require they meet specific goals for ethical and environmental sourcing.
    Cut out waste. With an estimated 8% of surplus products ending up in landfills, it’s essential to find ways to better reuse or recycle products. For example, some businesses resell returned or overstock items to liquidators, or they disassemble products and repurpose them.
    Form a committee that is passionate about sustainability and task them with tracking environmental metrics across your supply chain.

Being innovative and collaborative in this field pays off. Across the entire supply chain, there are various opportunities to streamline operations, lower costs, and create higher customer satisfaction.

Supply chain management field of operations: complex and dynamic supply and demand networks[1] (cf. Wieland/Wallenburg, 2011)
In an efficient supply chain, agreements are aligned.

In commerce, supply chain management (SCM) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management, logistics and marketing channels, through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers.[2][3] A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the "design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally".[4][5] This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.[6]

SCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.[7]

Supply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach.[8] Current [when?] research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management,[9] among others. Some suggest that the "people dimension" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.[10]
Mission

Supply chain management, techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC, from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs.[11]
Origin of the term and definitions

In 1982, Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, introduced the term "supply chain management" to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times.[12] In 1983 WirtschaftsWoche in Germany published for the first time the results of an implemented and so called "Supply Chain Management project", led by Wolfgang Partsch.[13]

In the mid-1990s, the term "supply chain management" gained popularity when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user or final consumer, as well as the associated information flows. Mentzer et al. consider it worthy of note that the final consumer was included within these early definitions.[14]: 2  Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage.[12]

In the late 1990s, "supply chain management" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity.[15][16][17] A supply chain, as opposed to supply chain management, is a set of firms who move materials "forward",[18] or a set of organizations, directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain.[14]

Other commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include:

    The management of upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among suppliers, company, resellers, and final consumers.[19]
    The systematic, strategic coordination of traditional business functions and tactics across all business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole.[14]
    A customer-focused definition is given by Hines (2004:p76): "Supply chain strategies require a total systems view of the links in the chain that work together efficiently to create customer satisfaction at the end point of delivery to the consumer. As a consequence, costs must be lowered throughout the chain by driving out unnecessary expenses, movements, and handling. The main focus is turned to efficiency and added value, or the end user's perception of value. Efficiency must be increased, and bottlenecks removed. The measurement of performance focuses on total system efficiency and the equitable monetary reward distribution to those within the supply chain. The supply chain system must be responsive to customer requirements."[20]
    The integration of key business processes across the supply chain for the purpose of creating value for customers and stakeholders.[21][22]
    According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, conversion, and logistics management. It also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which may be suppliers, intermediaries, third-party service providers, or customers.[23] Supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses that cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the Extended Enterprise.[citation needed]

Mentzer et al. make a further distinction between "supply chain management" and a "supply chain orientation". The latter term involves a recognition that a business strategy cannot be fulfilled without managing the activities of suppliers and customers upstream and downstream, whereas the former term is used for "the actual implementation of this orientation".[14]

Supply chain visibility, in its origins, was concerned with knowledge of the location, production stage and expected delivery date of incoming products and materials, so that production could be planned,[24] but the development of the term has enabled it to be used to plan orders using knowledge of potential supplies, and to track post-production processes as far as delivery to customers.[25] The UK Government also uses the term "supply chain visibility" in conjunction with its mandate to ensure that potential suppliers have visibility into future supply opportunities. The government's action note on supply chain visibility covers obligations and appropriate contractual wording requiring prime suppliers to advertise sub-contracting opportunities and to report on their spend with small and medium-sized enterprises and voluntary/community organisations within their supply chains.[26]

Supply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes.[27] The overall goal of the software is to improve supply chain performance by monitoring a company's supply chain network from end-to-end (suppliers, transporters, returns, warehouses, retailers, manufacturers, and customers).[27]

In some cases, a supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling or the reverse logistics processes for returning faulty or unwanted products back to producers up the value chain.[28]
Functions

Supply chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management.[29] Supply chain management is concerned with improving trust and collaboration among supply chain partners, thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement.[30][31]
Importance

Organizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy.[32] In Peter Drucker's (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies. According to Drucker, "the greatest change in corporate culture—and the way business is being conducted—may be the accelerated growth of relationships based not on ownership, but on partnership."[33] This approach allows companies to leverage the strengths and capabilities of various partners to achieve greater efficiency and innovation, ultimately enhancing overall business performance.[33][34]

In recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and information technology have enabled many organizations, such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard, to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities.[35] This inter-organizational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organization. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither "market" nor "hierarchy" categories.[36] It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply-network structures could have on firms, and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms.[37] Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance.[38]

In the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks. First, as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and business partnerships, significant success factors were identified, complementing the earlier "just-in-time", lean manufacturing, and agile manufacturing practices.[39][40][41][42] Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs (a significant component of transaction costs), have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network.[43]

Many researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organizational form, using terms such as "Keiretsu", "Extended Enterprise", "virtual supply chain",[44] "Global Production Network", and "Next Generation Manufacturing System".[45][46][47] In general, such a structure can be defined as "a group of semi-independent organizations, each with their capabilities, which collaborate in ever-changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration".[48]

The importance of supply chain management proved crucial in the 2019-2020 fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that swept across the world.[49] During the pandemic period, governments in countries which had in place effective domestic supply chain management had enough medical supplies to support their needs and enough to donate their surplus to front-line health workers in other jurisdictions.[50][51][52] The devastating COVID-19 crisis in US has turned many sectors of the local economy upside down, including the country's storied logistics industry. Some organizations were able to quickly develop foreign supply chains in order to import much needed medical supplies.[53][54][55]

Supply chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive.[56]

The security-management system for supply chains is described in ISO/IEC 28000 and ISO/IEC 28001 and related standards published jointly by the ISO and the IEC. Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.
Supply chain resilience

An important element of SCM is supply chain resilience, defined as "the capacity of a supply chain to persist, adapt, or transform in the face of change".[57] For a long time, the interpretation of resilience in the sense of engineering resilience (= robustness[58]) prevailed in supply chain management, leading to the notion of persistence.[57] A popular implementation of this idea is given by measuring the time-to-survive and the time-to-recover of the supply chain, allowing to identify weak points in the system.[59] The APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) program emphasizes the importance of managing risks and enhancing resilience. According to APICS, in order to manage global interruptions and preserve operational continuity, a robust supply chain is vital.[34]

More recently, the interpretations of resilience in the sense of ecological resilience and social–ecological resilience have led to the notions of adaptation and transformation, respectively.[57] A supply chain is thus interpreted as a social-ecological system that – similar to an ecosystem (e.g. forest) – is able to constantly adapt to external environmental conditions and – through the presence of social actors and their ability to foresight – also to transform itself into a fundamentally new system.[60] This leads to a panarchical interpretation of a supply chain, embedding it into a system of systems, allowing to analyze the interactions of the supply chain with systems that operate at other levels (e.g. society, political economy, planet Earth).[60]

For example, these three components of resilience can be discussed for the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction, when a ship blocked the canal for several days. Persistence means to "bounce back"; in our example it is about removing the ship as quickly as possible to allow "normal" operations. Adaptation means to accept that the system has reached a "new normal" state and to act accordingly; here, this can be implemented by redirecting ships around the African cape or use alternative modes of transport. Finally, transformation means to question the assumptions of globalization, outsourcing and linear supply chains and to envision alternatives; in this example this could lead to local and circular supply chains that do not need global transportation routes any longer.
Historical developments

Six major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply chain management studies: creation, integration, globalization,[61] specialization phases one and two, and SCM 2.0.
Creation era

The term "supply chain management" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. However, the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before, in the early 20th century, especially with the creation of the assembly line. The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large-scale changes, re-engineering, downsizing driven by cost reduction programs, and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However, the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in 1999 by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols, Jr.,[62] which published over 25,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian.[63]
Integration era

This era of supply chain management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in the 1960s and developed through the 1990s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This era has continued to develop into the 21st century with the expansion of Internet-based collaborative systems. This era of supply chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value-added and reducing costs through integration.[citation needed]

A supply chain can be classified as a stage 1, 2, or 3 network. In stage 1–type supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) is enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco.[citation needed]
Globalization era

It is the third movement of supply chain management development, the globalization era, can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organizations' supply chains can be traced back several decades (e.g., in the oil industry), it was not until the late 1980s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business.[citation needed] This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global sourcing.[citation needed]
Specialization era (phase I): outsourced manufacturing and distribution

In the 1990s, companies began to focus on "core competencies" and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration, sold off non-core operations, and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements, as the supply chain extended beyond the company walls and management was distributed across specialized supply chain partnerships.[citation needed]

This transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work-in-process visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI).[citation needed]

The specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers, suppliers, and customers that work together to design, manufacture, distribute, market, sell, and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market, region, or channel, resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments, each with its own unique characteristics and demands.[citation needed]
Specialization era (phase II): supply chain management as a service

Specialization within the supply chain began in the 1980s with the inception of transportation brokerages, warehouse management (storage and inventory), and non-asset-based carriers, and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning, collaboration, execution, and performance management.

Market forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers, logistics providers, locations, or customers in their role as components of supply chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply chain infrastructure, from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and workflows that are essential to the management of the network itself.

Supply chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done; it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific, best-in-class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself, thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain-specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply chain specialization is gaining popularity.

Outsourced technology hosting for supply chain solutions debuted in the late 1990s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider (ASP) model from roughly 1998 through 2003 to the on-demand model from approximately 2003 through 2006, to the software as a service (SaaS) model currently in focus today.
Supply chain management 2.0 (SCM 2.0)

The term SCM 2.0 has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes, methods, and tools to manage them in a new era of globalization and specialization. One element of this is the growing popularity of supply chain collaboration platforms that connect multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions, enabling them to conduct automated supply chain finance transactions.[64]

Web 2.0 is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity.

Increasing volatility has characterized supply chains since about 2000. Douglass in 2010 referred to an SCM management style known as "extreme supply chain management", which:

    recognizes the need for collective, rather than sequential, risk management and facilitates collaboration on a new scale that is necessary for survival. It challenges companies to be "perpetually vigilant".[65]

Business-process integration

Successful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply chain processes. In an example scenario, a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department, responding to customer demand, communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through business process integration, e.g., using electronic data interchange.

Supply chain business process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems, and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow. However, in many companies, management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply chain processes as stated by Lambert (2004)[66] are:

    Customer relationship management
    Customer service management
    Demand management
    Order fulfillment
    Manufacturing flow management
    Supplier relationship management
    Product development and commercialization
    Returns management

Much has been written about demand management.[67] Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which include the following:

    Internal and external collaboration
    Initiatives to reduce lead time
    Tighter feedback from customer and market demand
    Customer-level forecasting

One could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert, such as:

Customer service management process
    Customer relationship management concerns the relationship between an organization and its customers. Customer service is the source of customer information. It also provides the customer with real-time information on scheduling and product availability through interfaces with the company's production and distribution operations. Successful organizations use the following steps to build customer relationships:

        determine mutually satisfying goals for organization and customers
        establish and maintain customer rapport
        induce positive feelings in the organization and the customers

Business strategy integration

Effective business process integration in supply chain management requires not only continuous communication, but also strategic coordination across departments and partner companies. The main reason for this is that it can effectively improve agility.[68] At the same time, this integration can help businesses respond quickly to changes in demand and improve customer satisfaction.

Inventory management
    Inventory management is concerned with ensuring the right stock at the right levels, in the right place, at the right time and the right cost. Inventory management entails inventory planning and forecasting: forecasting helps planning inventory.

Procurement process
    Strategic plans are drawn up with suppliers to support the manufacturing flow management process and the development of new products.[69] In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance, many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.[70]

Product development and commercialization
    Here, customers and suppliers must be integrated into the product development process in order to reduce the time to market. As product life cycles shorten, the appropriate products must be developed and successfully launched with ever-shorter time schedules in order for firms to remain competitive. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), managers of the product development and commercialization process must:

        coordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs;
        select materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement; and
        develop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the given combination of product and markets.

Integration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and market share. Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual[71] property issues.

Manufacturing flow management process
    The manufacturing process produces and supplies products to the distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times (cycle time compression), meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. La Londe and Masters found in 1994 research that improved supply chain management and cycle time compression were complementary strategies adopted by forward-looking businesses in the United States.[18] This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.

Physical distribution
    This concerns the movement of a finished product or service to customers. In physical distribution, the customer is the final destination of a marketing channel, and the availability of the product or service is a vital part of each channel participant's marketing effort. It is also through the physical distribution process that the time and space of customer service become an integral part of marketing. Thus it links a marketing channel with its customers (i.e., it links manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers).

Outsourcing/partnerships
    This includes not just the outsourcing of the procurement of materials and components, but also the outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain in which it has a distinctive advantage and outsource everything else. This movement has been particularly evident in logistics, where the provision of transport, storage, and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, managing and controlling this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of central and local involvement: strategic decisions are taken centrally, while the monitoring and control of supplier performance and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners are best managed locally.

Performance measurement
    Experts found a strong relationship from the largest arcs of supplier and customer integration to market share and profitability. Taking advantage of supplier capabilities and emphasizing a long-term supply chain perspective in customer relationships can both be correlated with a firm's performance. As logistics competency becomes a critical factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, measuring logistics performance becomes increasingly important, because the difference between profitable and unprofitable operations becomes narrower. A.T. Kearney Consultants (1985) noted that firms engaging in comprehensive performance measurement realized improvements in overall productivity. According to experts,[who?] internal measures are generally collected and analyzed by the firm, including cost, customer service, productivity, asset measurement, and quality. External performance is measured through customer perception measures and "best practice" benchmarking.

Warehousing management
    To reduce a company's cost and expenses, warehousing management is concerned with storage, reducing manpower cost, dispatching authority with on time delivery, loading and unloading facilities with proper area, inventory management system etc.

Workflow management
    Integrating suppliers and customers tightly into a workflow (or business process) and thereby achieving an efficient and effective supply chain is a key goal of workflow management.

Theories

There are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present.[72] A few authors, such as Halldorsson et al.,[73] Ketchen and Hult (2006),[74] and Lavassani et al. (2009), have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories, which may include the following:

    Resource-based view (RBV)[75]
    Transaction cost analysis (TCA)
    Knowledge-based view (KBV)
    Strategic choice theory (SCT)
    Agency theory (AT)
    Channel coordination
    Institutional theory (InT)
    Systems theory (ST)
    Network perspective (NP)
    Materials logistics management (MLM)
    Just-in-time (JIT)
    Material requirements planning (MRP)
    Theory of constraints (TOC)
    Total quality management (TQM)
    Agile manufacturing
    Time-based competition (TBC)
    Quick response manufacturing (QRM)
    Customer relationship management (CRM)
    Requirements chain management (RCM)
    Dynamic Capabilities Theory
    Dynamic Management Theory
    Available-to-promise (ATP)
    Supply Chain Roadmap[76]
    Optimal Positioning of the Delivery Window (OPDW)[77][78]

However, the unit of analysis of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system, such as the firm or the supplier-buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the relational view, which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998).[79]
Organization and governance

The management of supply chains involve a number of specific challenges regarding the organization of relationships among the different partners along the value chain. Formal and informal governance mechanisms are central elements in the management of supply chain.[80] Particular combinations of governance mechanisms may impact the relational dynamics within the supply chain. The need for interdisciplinarity in SCM research has been pointed out by academics in the field.[81]
Supply chain centroids

In the study of supply chain management, the concept of centroids has become a useful economic consideration. In mathematics and physics, a centroid is the arithmetic mean position of all the points in a plane figure.[82] For supply chain management, a centroid is a location with a high proportion of a country's population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500 mi (805 km). In the US, two major supply chain centroids have been defined, one near Dayton, Ohio, and a second near Riverside, California.[citation needed][83]

The centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within 500 miles of 60% of the US population and manufacturing capacity, as well as 60% of Canada's population.[84] The region includes the interchange between I-70 and I-75, one of the busiest in the nation, with 154,000 vehicles passing through per day, of which 30–35% are trucks hauling goods. In addition, the I-75 corridor is home to the busiest north–south rail route east of the Mississippi River.[84]

A supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product. A supply chain encompasses everything from the delivery of source materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user. The supply chain segment involved with getting the finished product from the manufacturer to the consumer is known as the distribution channel.[85]

In 2010, Wal-Mart announced a big change in its sourcing strategy. Initially, Wal-Mart relied on intermediaries in the sourcing process. It bought only 20% of its stock directly, but the rest were bought through the intermediaries.[86] Therefore, the company came to realize that the presence of many intermediaries in the product sourcing was actually increasing the costs in the supply chain. To cut these costs, Wal-Mart decided to do away with intermediaries in the supply chain and started direct sourcing of its goods from the suppliers. Eduardo Castro-Wright, the then Vice President of Wal-Mart, set an ambitious goal of buying 80% of all Wal-Mart goods directly from the suppliers.[87] Walmart started purchasing fruits and vegetables on a global scale, where it interacted directly with the suppliers of these goods. The company later engaged the suppliers of other goods, such as cloth and home electronics appliances, directly and eliminated the importing agents. The purchaser, in this case Wal-Mart, can easily direct the suppliers on how to manufacture certain products so that they can be acceptable to the consumers.[88] Thus, Wal-Mart, through direct sourcing, manages to get the exact product quality as it expects, since it engages the suppliers in the producing of these products, hence quality consistency.[87] Using agents in the sourcing process in most cases lead to inconsistency in the quality of the products, since the agent's source the products from different manufacturers that have varying qualities.

Wal-Mart managed to source directly 80% profit its stock; this has greatly eliminated the intermediaries and cut down the costs between 5-15%, as markups that are introduced by these middlemen in the supply chain are cut. This saves approximately $4–15 billion.[86] This strategy of direct sourcing not only helped Wal-Mart in reducing the costs in the supply chain but also helped in the improvement of supply chain activities through boosting efficiency throughout the entire process. In other words, direct sourcing reduced the time that takes the company to source and stocks the products in its stock.[87] The presence of the intermediaries elongated the time in the process of procurement, which sometimes led to delays in the supply of the commodities in the stores, thus, customers finding empty shelves. Wal-Mart adopted this strategy of sourcing through centralizing the entire process of procurement and sourcing by setting up four global merchandising points for general goods and clothing. The company instructed all the suppliers to bring their products to these central points that are located in different markets.[88] The procurement team assesses the quality brought by the suppliers, buys the goods, and distributes them to various regional markets. The procurement and sourcing at centralized places helped the company to consolidate the suppliers.

The company has established four centralized points, including an office in Mexico City and Canada. Just a mere piloting test on combining the purchase of fresh apples across the United States, Mexico, and Canada led to the savings of about 10%. As a result, the company intended to increase centralization of its procurement in North America for all its fresh fruits and vegetables.[86] Thus, centralization of the procurement process to various points where the suppliers would be meeting with the procurement team is the latest strategy which the company is implementing, and signs show that this strategy is going to cut costs and also improve the efficiency of the procurement process.

Strategic vendor partnerships is another strategy the company is using in the sourcing process. Wal-Mart realized that in order for it to ensure consistency in the quality of the products it offers to the consumers and also maintain a steady supply of goods in its stores at a lower cost, it had to create strategic vendor partnerships with the suppliers.[86] Wal-Mart identified and selected the suppliers who met its demand and at the same time offered it the best prices for the goods. It then made a strategic relationship with these vendors by offering and assuring the long-term and high volume of purchases in exchange for the lowest possible prices.[87] Thus, the company has managed to source its products from same suppliers as bulks, but at lower prices. This enables the company to offer competitive prices for its products in its stores, hence, maintaining a competitive advantage over its competitors whose goods are a more expensive in comparison.

Another sourcing strategy Wal-Mart uses is implementing efficient communication relationships with the vendor networks; this is necessary to improve the material flow. The company has all the contacts with the suppliers whom they communicate regularly and make dates on when the goods would be needed, so that the suppliers get ready to deliver the goods in time.[89] The efficient communication between the company's procurement team and the inventory management team enables the company to source goods and fill its shelves on time, without causing delays and empty shelves.[90] In other words, the company realized that in ensuring a steady flow of the goods into the store, the suppliers have to be informed early enough, so that they can act accordingly to avoid delays in the delivery of goods.[87] Thus, efficient communication is another tool which Wal-Mart is using to make the supply chain be more efficient and to cut costs.

Cross-docking is another strategy that Wal-Mart is using to cut costs in its supply chain. Cross-docking is the process of transferring goods directly from inbound trucks to outbound trucks.[86] When the trucks from the suppliers arrive at the distribution centers, most of the trucks are not offloaded to keep the goods in the distribution centers or warehouses; they are transferred directly to another truck designated to deliver goods to specific retail stores for sale. Cross-docking helps in saving the storage costs.[91] Initially, the company was incurring considerable costs of storing the goods from the suppliers in its warehouses and the distributions centers to await the distribution trucks to the retail stores in various regions.
Tax-efficient supply chain management

Tax-efficient supply chain management is a business model that considers the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management. As the consequence of globalization, cross-national businesses pay different tax rates in different countries. Due to these differences, they may legally optimize their supply chain and increase profits based on tax efficiency.[92][failed verification]
Sustainability and social responsibility in supply chains

Supply chain networks are integral to an economy, but their health is dependent on the well-being of the environment and society.[93] Supply chain sustainability is a business issue affecting an organization's supply chain or logistics network, and is frequently quantified by comparison with SECH ratings, which address social, ethical, cultural, and health footprints. These build on the triple bottom line incorporating economic, social, and environmental aspects.[94][95] The more commonly used ESG terminology represents Environment, Social and Governance. Consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and companies' ratings and, along with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), are setting the agenda, and beginning to push for transitions to more sustainable approaches such as organically grown foods, anti-sweatshop labor codes, and locally produced goods that support independent and small businesses. Because supply chains may account for over 75% of a company's carbon footprint, many organizations are exploring ways to reduce this and thus improve their profile.

For example, in July 2009, Wal-Mart announced its intentions to create a global sustainability index that would rate products according to the environmental and social impacts of their manufacturing and distribution. The index is intended to create environmental accountability in Wal-Mart's supply chain and to provide motivation and infrastructure for other retail companies to do the same.[96]

It has been reported that companies are increasingly taking environmental performance into account when selecting suppliers. A 2011 survey by the Carbon Trust found that 50% of multinationals expect to select their suppliers based upon carbon performance in the future and 29% of suppliers could lose their places on 'green supply chains' if they do not have adequate performance records on carbon.[97]

In addition to environmental concerns, increased globalization within global supply chains challenges human rights and worker exploitation risks within multinational corporations including forced labor and modern slavery. Textiles, agriculture, and manufacturing are some of the industries with significant labor exploitation risks.[98] There are many different methods governments, corporations, and NGOs use to prevent labor exploitation, including corporate social responsibility,[99] export controls,[100] import bans,[101] and monitoring labor standards.[102][103]

The US Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, contained a supply chain sustainability provision in the form of the Conflict Minerals law. This law requires SEC-regulated companies to conduct third party audits of their supply chains in order to determine whether any tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (together referred to as conflict minerals) is mined or sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and create a report (available to the general public and SEC) detailing the due diligence efforts taken and the results of the audit.[104] The chain of suppliers and vendors to these reporting companies will be expected to provide appropriate supporting information.

Incidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse, with more than 1,100 victims, have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers. They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully managing social responsibility in supply chains.[105] Recent research proposes a two-phase approach for auditing multitier supply networks.[106] Under this strategy, buyers first audit and drop noncompliant suppliers and then proceed to audit and rectify the remaining ones; when auditing an upper tier, the approach recommends selecting the "least valuable unaudited supplier" as the next candidate for auditing.
Circular supply chain management

Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM) is "the configuration and coordination of the organizational functions marketing, sales, R&D, production, logistics, IT, finance, and customer service within and across business units and organizations to close, slow, intensify, narrow, and dematerialise material and energy loops to minimize resource input into and waste and emission leakage out of the system, improve its operative effectiveness and efficiency and generate competitive advantages". By reducing resource input and waste leakage along the supply chain and configure it to enable the recirculation of resources at different stages of the product or service lifecycle, potential economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. These comprise e.g. a decrease in material and waste management cost and reduced emissions and resource consumption.[107]
Components
Management components

SCM components are the third element of the four-square circulation framework.[clarification needed] The level of integration and management of a business process link is a function of the number and level of components added to the link.[108][109] Consequently, adding more management components or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link.

Literature on business process reengineering,[110][111][112] buyer-supplier relationships,[113][108][114] and SCM[22][115][116] suggests various possible components that should receive managerial attention when managing supply relationships. Lambert and Cooper (2000) identified the following components:

    Planning and control
    Work structure
    Organization structure
    Product flow facility structure
    Information flow facility structure
    Management methods
    Power and leadership structure
    Risk and reward structure
    Culture and attitude

However, a more careful examination of the existing literature[37][117][118][119][120][121][122][123][124] leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what should be the key critical supply chain components, or "branches" of the previously identified supply chain business processes—that is, what kind of relationship the components may have that are related to suppliers and customers. Bowersox and Closs (1996) state that the emphasis on cooperation represents the synergism leading to the highest level of joint achievement. A primary-level channel participant is a business that is willing to participate in responsibility for inventory ownership or assume other financial risks, thus including primary level components.[125] A secondary-level participant (specialized) is a business that participates in channel relationships by performing essential services for primary participants, including secondary level components, which support primary participants. Third-level channel participants and components that support primary-level channel participants and are the fundamental branches of secondary-level components may also be included.

Consequently, Lambert and Cooper's framework of supply chain components does not lead to any conclusion about what are the primary- or secondary-level (specialized) supply chain components[126] —that is, which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary, how these components should be structured in order to achieve a more comprehensive supply chain structure, and how to examine the supply chain as an integrative one.
Power in supply chain management

Andrew Cox, Joe Sanderson and Glyn Watson argue that the power resources of buyers and suppliers should be analyzed in order to understand how a supply chain relationship operates. In some cases, a purchasing firm may exercise more power over its suppliers, in other cases, suppliers may have more power; yet again there will be cases where buyers and suppliers may be interdependent or may have no real power over each other.[127] Cox, Sanderson and Watson have written extensively on the operation of power regimes within a supply chain context;[128] they have described their work for themselves as "a new perspective on managing in supply chains and networks".[129] Other studies of power in supply chain relationships have looked at drivers impacting on the potential integration of supply chains. A study by Michael Maloni and W. C. Benton in 1998 looked at whether potential asymmetries in inter-firm power within a supply chain could prevent the implementation of effective supply chain execution. Maloni and Benton note that until their research, "little power research" had been presented in the supply chain literature. Using French and Raven's typology of the sources of power in the context of the automotive industry, they aimed to analyse the effects of distinct power strategies on relationships between buyers and sellers, and upon supply chain performance and satisfaction. Their findings showed that:

    expert and referent power sources lent themselves to "significant positive effects" on supply chain relationships;
    reward power had a somewhat beneficial impact
    coercive and legal/legitimate power bases, which they describe as "completely mediated power strategies", led to "significant negative relationships".

They concluded that "prudent use of power" can be beneficial for both the power source and the power target.[130]
Reverse supply chain

Reverse logistics is the process of managing the return of goods and may be considered as an aspect of "aftermarket customer services".[131] Any time money is taken from a company's warranty reserve or service logistics budget, one can speak of a reverse logistics operation. Reverse logistics also includes the process of managing the return of goods from store, which the returned goods are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise.
Supply Chain Engineering

Although it has the same goals as supply chain engineering, supply chain management is focused on a more traditional management and business based approach, whereas supply chain engineering is focused on a mathematical model based one.[132]
Digitizing supply chains

Consultancies and media expect the performance efficacy of digitizing supply chains to be high.[133] Additive manufacturing and blockchain technology have emerged as the two technologies with some of the highest economic relevance.

Additive manufacturing
    The potential of additive manufacturing is particularly high in the production of spare parts, since its introduction can reduce warehousing costs of slowly rotating spare parts.[134] Digitizing technology bears the potential to completely disrupt and restructure supply chains and enhance existing production routes.[135]

Blockchain
    In comparison, research on the influence of blockchain technology on the supply chain is still in its early stages. The conceptual literature has argued for a considerably long time that the highest performance efficacy is expected in the potential for automatic contract creation.[136] Empirical evidence contradicts this hypothesis: the highest potential is expected in the arenas of verified customer reviews and certifications of product quality and standards.[137] In addition, traditional supply chain has many drawbacks such as lack of transparency and trust, and some of them can be solved by blockchain technology.[138] The technological features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of information, as well as high levels of reliability and immutability of records.[139] That helps traditional supply chain management to be more efficient and reliable.

Systems and value

Supply chain systems configure value for those that organize the networks. Value is the additional revenue over and above the costs of building the network. Co-creating value and sharing the benefits appropriately to encourage effective participation is a key challenge for any supply system. Tony Hines defines value as follows: "Ultimately it is the customer who pays the price for service delivered that confirms value and not the producer who simply adds cost until that point".[20]
Global applications

Global supply chains pose challenges regarding both quantity and value. Supply and value chain trends include:

    Globalization
    Increased cross-border sourcing
    Collaboration for parts of value chain with low-cost providers
    Shared service centers for logistical and administrative functions
    Increasingly global operations, which require increasingly global coordination and planning to achieve global optimums
    Complex problems involve also midsized companies to an increasing degree

These trends have many benefits for manufacturers because they make possible larger lot sizes, lower taxes, and better environments (e.g., culture, infrastructure, special tax zones, or sophisticated OEM) for their products. There are many additional challenges when the scope of supply chains is global. This is because with a supply chain of a larger scope, the lead time is much longer, and because there are more issues involved, such as multiple currencies, policies, and laws. The consequent problems include different currencies and valuations in different countries, different tax laws, different trading protocols, vulnerability to natural disasters and cyber threats,[140] and lack of transparency of cost and profit.
Roles and responsibilities

Supply chain professionals play major roles in the design and management of supply chains. In the design of supply chains, they help determine whether a product or service is provided by the firm itself (insourcing) or by another firm elsewhere (outsourcing). In the management of supply chains, supply chain professionals coordinate production among multiple providers, ensuring that production and transport of goods happen with minimal quality control or inventory problems. One goal of a well-designed and maintained supply chain for a product is to successfully build the product at minimal cost. Such a supply chain could be considered a competitive advantage for a firm.[141][142]

Beyond design and maintenance of a supply chain itself, supply chain professionals participate in aspects of business that have a bearing on supply chains, such as sales forecasting, quality management, strategy development, customer service, and systems analysis. Production of a good may evolve over time, rendering an existing supply chain design obsolete. Supply chain professionals need to be aware of changes in production and business climate that affect supply chains and create alternative supply chains as the need arises.

In a research project undertaken by Michigan State University's Broad College of Business, with input from 50 participating organizations, the main issues of concern to supply chain managers were identified as capacity/resource availability, talent (recruitment), complexity, threats/challenges (supply chain risks), compliance and cost/purchasing issues. Keeping up with frequent changes in regulation was identified as a particular concern.[143] Complexity within supply chains has also been highlighted in Supply Chain Digest and by Gartner as a perennial challenge.[144][145]

Supply chain consultants may provide expert knowledge in order to assess the productivity of a supply chain and, ideally, to enhance its productivity. Supply chain consulting involves the transfer of knowledge on how to exploit existing assets through improved coordination and can hence be a source of competitive advantage: the role of the consultant is to help management by adding value to the whole process through the various sectors from the ordering of the raw materials to the final product.[146] In this regard, firms may either build internal teams of consultants to tackle the issue or engage external ones: companies choose between these two approaches taking into consideration various factors.[147]

The use of external consultants is a common practice among companies.[148] The whole consulting process generally involves the analysis of the entire supply chain process, including the countermeasures or correctives to take to achieve a better overall performance.[149]
Skills and competencies

Supply chain professionals need to have knowledge of managing supply chain functions such as transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and production planning. In the past, supply chain professionals emphasized logistics skills, such as knowledge of shipping routes, familiarity with warehousing equipment and distribution center locations and footprints, and a solid grasp of freight rates and fuel costs. More recently, supply chain management extends to logistical support across firms and management of global supply chains.[150] Supply chain professionals need to have an understanding of business continuity basics and strategies,[151] and Tramarico et al noted that several processes from other disciplinary theories, including the resource-based view, supply chain design and interorganizational relationships are integral to a mature understanding of supply chain management.[152] A shortage of skilled supply chain professionals was highlighted in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published in 2010, which highlighted plentiful supply of staff with "narrow technical skillsets" but shortages in the numbers of job applicants with "broader business skills".[153][154]
Certification

Individuals working in supply chain management can attain professional certification by passing an exam developed by a third party certification organization. The purpose of certification is to guarantee a certain level of expertise in the field. The knowledge needed to pass a certification exam may be gained from several sources. Some knowledge may come from college courses, but most of it is acquired from a mix of on-the-job learning experiences, attending industry events, learning best practices with their peers, and reading books and articles in the field.[155] Certification organizations may provide certification workshops tailored to their exams.[156]
University rankings

The following North American universities rank high in their master's education in the SCM World University 100 ranking, which was published in 2017 and which is based on the opinions of supply chain managers: Michigan State University, Penn State University, University of Tennessee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Arizona State University, University of Texas at Austin and Western Michigan University. In the same ranking, the following European universities rank high: Cranfield School of Management, Vlerick Business School, INSEAD, Cambridge University, Eindhoven University of Technology, London Business School and Copenhagen Business School.[157]

The following universities rank high in the 2016 Eduniversal Best Masters ranking for supply chain and logistics: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, KEDGE Business School, Purdue University, Rotterdam School of Management, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Vienna University of Economics and Business and Copenhagen Business School.[158]
Organizations

A number of organizations provide certification in supply chain management, such as the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP),[159] IIPMR (International Institute for Procurement and Market Research), APICS (the Association for Operations Management), ISCEA (International Supply Chain Education Alliance) and IoSCM (Institute of Supply Chain Management). APICS' certification is called Certified Supply Chain Professional, or CSCP, and ISCEA's certification is called the Certified Supply Chain Manager (CSCM), CISCM (Chartered Institute of Supply Chain Management) awards certificate as Chartered Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP). Another, the Institute for Supply Management, is developing one called the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)[160] focused on the procurement and sourcing areas of supply chain management. The Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA) is the main certifying body for Canada with the designations having global reciprocity. The designation Supply Chain Management Professional (SCMP) is the title of the supply chain leadership designation.

Operational accounting
Supply chains play a critical role in economies all around the world. Every product and service has a supply chain. Effective supply chain management means the difference between having enough medicine, food or critical supplies to meet demand or facing shortages and bare shelves.

Supply chain management comprises forecasting and demand planning; sourcing and procurement of supplies and products; supplier management; manufacturing or production; inventory management; warehousing; the logistics of moving supplies and end-products among various facilities, warehouses, retail locations and the end customer; the reverse logistics of returned or damaged products; monitoring of industry trends to prepare for the future; and more. All of these moving parts must work together to deliver the products people need to work and live. Supply chain management professionals are the people who make this happen.

What is supply chain management?

According to the ASCM Supply Chain Dictionary, supply chain management is the design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand, and measuring performance globally.

Any product you can think of has a supply chain — take a package of cookies: At a high level, supply chain professionals at the company that produces the cookies would need to monitor sales and market data to forecast demand so they know how much to produce; source the ingredients; manage the process of baking the cookies; maintain the baking equipment; source packaging material; manage the packaging process; broker deals with retailers to sell the cookies; and move the cookies to warehouses and then to retailers, where the end-customer buys the cookies. In addition, they would also need professionals to help with risk management by maintaining product integrity throughout the manufacturing and shipping processes and recall items not fit for consumption, manage the people supporting operations, build relationships with suppliers and customers, measure progress, share appropriate data, innovate for new kinds of cookies, and more.

Supply chain fundamentals
History of supply chain management

Some aspects of supply chain management have been around for centuries. Hyperlocal supply chains enabled communities to feed, clothe and house their members. Ancient trade routes required logistics and distribution to exchange goods around the world. Otherwise, supply chains were mostly localized until the mid-1700s, but they used many supply chain functions, including sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and distribution. The Industrial Revolution expanded manufacturing capabilities, and then railroad development in the 1800s expanded distribution capabilities. More transportation opportunities continued to increase the possibilities, as trucks, planes and drones were developed. When businesses could reach farther distances in less time, they expanded their markets, their manufacturing and sales plans, and ultimately their supply chains.
History of supply chain management

After capabilities came efficiencies. Mass production introduced more efficient manufacturing practices, pallets optimized warehousing and storage, and containers improved volume efficiency for logistics and distribution. More capabilities and efficiencies were unlocked with the availability of computers. Algorithms, spreadsheets and optimization models advanced planning, forecasting, production, inventory tracking, distribution monitoring and more. Supply chain management has continued to evolve at a rapid pace, constantly adapting to changing markets, advancing technology and a variety of disruptions.
Why is supply chain management important?

At its core, supply chain management ensures companies are prepared to meet demand and that products and services arrive at the right place at the right time. The early 2020s demonstrated the importance of supply chain management and what can happen when companies are not prepared for changes and disruptions. During the pandemic, the supply-demand balance tipped severely, and consumers were left paying drastically increased prices or having to go without important items.

When supply chain links aren’t functioning properly, orders are not fulfilled, and people do not have the products they need. When effective supply chain management is applied, companies not only meet demand but have lower costs, higher efficiency, less risk, higher customer satisfaction, greater visibility of their operations and greater agility to respond to disruptions.  

As supply chains extend their reach around the world, they can bring both necessary and new and exciting products to people in various countries. This can improve people’s lives in many ways — in particular, by more effectively meeting people’s needs and by creating rewarding jobs.
The Supply Chain: From Raw Materials to Order Fulfillment What Is a Supply Chain?

A supply chain is a network of individuals and companies that are involved in creating a product and delivering it to the consumer. Links on the chain begin with the producers of the raw materials and they end when the van delivers the finished product to the user.

Supply chain management is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a more efficient production cycle. Companies seek to improve their supply chains so they can reduce their costs and remain competitive.

Understanding a Supply Chain

A supply chain includes every step that's involved in getting a finished product or service to the customer. The steps may include sourcing raw materials, moving them to production, then transporting the finished products to a distribution center or retail store where they can be delivered to consumers.

The entities involved in the supply chain include producers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, distribution centers, and retailers.

The supply chain begins operating when a business receives an order from a customer. Its essential functions include product development, marketing, operations, distribution networks, finance, and customer service.

It can lower a company's overall costs and boost its profitability when supply chain management is effective. It can affect the rest of the chain and can be costly if one link breaks.
What Are the Main Supply Chain Models?

The supply chain model that a company selects will depend on how the company is structured and its specific needs.

    Continuous Flow Model: This traditional supply chain model works well for companies that produce the same products with little variation. The products should be in high demand and require little to no redesign. This lack of fluctuation means managers can streamline production times and keep tight control over inventory. Managers must regularly replenish raw materials to prevent production bottlenecks in a continuous flow model.
    Fast Chain Model: This model works best for companies that sell products based on the latest trends. Businesses that use this model must get their products to market quickly to take advantage of the prevailing trend. They must rapidly move from idea to prototype to production to consumer. Fast fashion is an example of an industry that uses this supply chain model.
    Flexible Model: Companies that manufacture seasonal or holiday merchandise often use the flexible model. They experience surges in demand for their products followed by long periods of little to no demand. Using the flexible model ensures that they're able to gear up quickly to begin production and shut down efficiently as soon as demand tapers off. Profit depends on being accurate in forecasting their need for raw materials, inventory, and labor.

What Are Supply Chain Management Best Practices?

Successful supply chain management systems benefit from several practices:

    They support continuous improvement.
    They aim for increased velocity.
    They encourage collaboration among the individual businesses in the supply chain.
    They seek new technologies that improve their processes.
    They have metrics in place that allow employees to measure the success or failure of each step in the supply chain.

Supply Chain Management vs. Business Logistics Management?

The terms supply chain management (SCM) and business logistics management or simply logistics are often used interchangeably but logistics is one link in the supply chain.

Logistics deals with the planning and control of the movement and storage of goods and services from their point of origin to their final destination.

Successful logistics management ensures that there's no delay in delivery at any point in the chain and that products and services are delivered in good condition. This helps keep the company's costs down.
What Is the Flow of Manufacturing Costs?

Efficient supply chain systems can get each piece of the product to the location where it's needed when it's needed. This requires control of the flow of manufacturing costs.

The flow of manufacturing costs is most relevant to businesses that produce products that require many parts from several vendors. A clothing manufacturer might need deliveries of fabric, zippers, trim, and thread that must all arrive at the same time. They must be stored at the business' expense if some supplies arrive too early and the machines stand idle while they wait if some arrive late.
Reliable Suppliers Are Key

An efficient supply chain management process requires reliable suppliers that produce a product that meets the manufacturer’s specifications and deliver it on time.

Assume that XYZ Furniture manufactures high-end furniture and that a supplier provides metal handles and other attachments. The metal components must be durable so they last for many years. They must meet the design and quality specified by the manufacturer and they must work as intended.

A reliable supplier will fill the manufacturer’s order and ship the parts on time.
Does the Supply Chain Cause Deflation?

The increased efficiencies of supply chains have played a significant role in curbing inflation. Costs decrease as efficiencies in moving products from point A to point B increase. This reduces the final cost to the consumer. Deflation is often regarded as a negative but supply chain efficiencies are one of the few examples in which it's a good thing.

Supply chain efficiencies become more optimized as globalization increases and this keeps the pressure on input prices.
How Did COVID-19 Affect the Supply Chain?

One of the most severe economic problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was damage to the supply chain. Its effects touched nearly every sector of the economy.1
Important

Supplies of products of all kinds were delayed due to ever-changing restrictions at national borders and long backups in ports.2

Demand for products changed abruptly. Shortages developed as consumers hoarded essentials like toilet paper and baby formula. Masks, cleaning wipes, and hand sanitizers were suddenly in demand.3

Shortages of computer chips delayed the delivery of a wide range of products from electronics to toys and cars.4
Shifting Priorities

A survey by Ernst & Young of 200 senior-level supply chain executives points to three essential findings:

    The pandemic had a deep negative effect as cited by 72% of supply chain executives. Automotive and industrial supplies companies were hit the worst.
    Visibility was the top priority. Executives wanted to focus on adding technology such as sensors that gave them a better view of their orders throughout the process.
    The pandemic accelerated the transition to digitization. Most of those surveyed said that digital transformation combined with increased automation would accelerate going forward.5

What Is Supply Chain Management?

Supply chain management (SCM) is the oversight and control of all the activities required for a company to convert raw materials into finished products that are then sold to users. It provides centralized control for the planning, design, manufacturing, inventory, and distribution phases required to produce and sell a company's products.

A goal of supply chain management is to improve efficiency by coordinating the efforts of the various entities in the supply chain. This can result in a company achieving a competitive advantage over its rivals and enhancing the quality of the products it produces. Both can lead to increased sales and revenue.
What Are the Steps in a Supply Chain?

The key steps in a supply chain include:

    Planning the inventory and manufacturing processes to ensure that supply and demand are adequately balanced
    Manufacturing or sourcing the materials needed to create the final product
    Assembling parts and testing the product
    Packaging the product for shipment or holding it in inventory until a later date
    Transporting and delivering the finished product to the distributor, retailer, or consumer.
    Providing customer service support for returned items

What Is an Example of a Supply Chain?

A supply chain begins with the sourcing of raw materials. The raw materials are then hauled to a wholesaler that sells them in batches to manufacturers. The manufacturer uses the materials to create a product which is then delivered to a retailer. Finally, it's sold to a consumer.
The Bottom Line

A supply chain is what lets you plug in your new television or bite down on that hamburger you’ve made at home. It’s a network made up of producers and manufacturers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, and retailers. The process begins when a product is created and it ends when you purchase it. Many supply chains are global in scale.

Each step in the process is complicated by the need to create, prepare, package, ship, and unpack the product at each of its successive destinations but it can result in lower costs when it's done effectively. This benefit can be passed on to consumers.
What is a supply chain?

A supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product. A supply chain encompasses everything from the delivery of source materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user. The supply chain segment involved with getting the finished product from the manufacturer to the consumer is known as the distribution channel.
Steps in the supply chain

The fundamental steps of a supply chain in order are as follows:

    Sourcing raw materials.
    Refining those materials into basic parts.
    Combining those basic parts to create a product.
    Order fulfillment/Sales.
    Product delivery.
    Customer support and return services.

The amount of time it takes any one of these processes from start to completion is known as lead time. Supply chains are managed by supply chain managers, who monitor lead time and coordinate the processes in each step to maximize customer satisfaction.

Supply chains can be contrasted against value chains -- they contribute to the end product in different ways. Supply chains aim to meet customer demands. Value chains seek to add value to a product on top of its inherent value. The purpose of the value chain is to give the company a competitive advantage in the industry. Supply chain management and value chain management are two slightly different perspectives on the same basic process and work in tandem to meet two slightly different definitions of "demand."
Supply chain management

Supply chain management (SCM) is the oversight of materials, information and finances as they move in a process from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer and then to the consumer. The three main flows of the supply chain are the product flow, the information flow and the finances flow. These occur across three main stages: strategy, planning and operation. SCM involves coordinating and integrating these flows both within and among companies.

Supply chain models

There are several common supply chain business models that supply chains fit into. The models have two main focuses: responsiveness and efficiency. Each model strives for some combination of both but approaches those goals differently. In addition, models tend to favor one over the other. Organizations can evaluate the value proposition of each in relation to their goals and constraints, and choose which suits them best.

The model types are:

    Continuous flow model -- works best for mature industries with a degree of stability.
    Agile model -- works best for industries with unpredictable demand and products that are made to order.
    Fast chain model -- works best for products with a short lifecycle, such as fashion items.
    Flexible model -- works best for industries with a level of stability and a few relatively predictable demand peaks.
    Custom configured model -- focuses on customizing.
    Efficient chain model -- works best for highly competitive markets in which pricing plays a large part.

The models are subject to overlap and should be designed by the supply chain manager to fit the unique supply chain.
Supply chain challenges

Modern supply chains are complex and present several common challenges. These are:

    Potential lack of transparency. Having transparency enables stakeholders to understand the status of the supply chain.
    Waste due to inadequate production cycle. Businesses that inaccurately gauge their supply, demand or capabilities may end up with an overstocked inventory.
    Unsatisfied business partners and customers. The ultimate goal of SCM is to meet customer expectations. This involves managing those expectations realistically, but also providing a valuable product.
    Lost or delayed goods. Goods that go missing at any point in the chain ultimately delay the whole process and can impact customers negatively.
    Increasing customer expectations. New technology and businesses raise customer expectations, which can be difficult to manage, and impossible to meet if not properly managed.
    Resiliency to sudden changes in the supply chain. External factors can cause unforeseen changes in a supply chain, so best practice is to prepare for the unexpected and be able to pivot if need be.

Supply chain best practices

Supply chain managers need to adapt to the growing speed and scale of the global marketplace. Best practices for doing this include:

    Use lean SCM and logistics techniques. Lean increases flexibility and minimizes inventory waste.
    Increase inventory velocity. Companies need to ensure their supply doesn't outweigh demand, and that they can capitalize on distributed, quickly changing demand. Lean is one way to do this.
    Enterprises need to collaborate with other businesses in their supply chain to optimize the entire chain, not just one company's process. The relationship with suppliers is especially important.
    Shorten cycles. As supply chains become more complex, they get longer, and so do processes. Businesses should aim to keep them as short as possible to meet customer expectations.
    Use supply chain technology. Technology allows managers to integrate their supply chains and collaborate more effectively.
    Implement useful metrics. Well-defined metrics allow managers to accurately gauge the efficiency of the chain.

The evolution and future of the supply chain

In the 1980s and 1990s, increasing globalization, outsourcing and availability of information spurred the need to integrate business processes across the entire global supply chain, which resulted in the idea of supply chain management. This marked a shift from the traditional supply chain, which just involved the basic logistic steps of production. With the integration, companies gained more visibility in steps following and preceding theirs in the chain, and each company involved in a supply chain became focused on optimizing the entire chain instead of just their local process.

As such, market competition dynamics changed as well. Instead of individual companies in competition, entire chains consisting of several enterprises would compete, as company investment in their respective chains grew. Enterprises began to outsource manufacturing and logistics processes to third-party companies.

The increase in visibility as a result of globalization and advancing technology had beneficial effects for businesses, such as improved product traceability and social responsibility efforts.

Since then, the evolution of internet businesses, the internet of things (IoT) and mobile computing have changed the way customers order products and the way businesses work. The internet enables customers to directly contact product distributers. This has consequently shortened the supply chain by removing some middlemen and encouraged collaboration.

However, internet businesses like Amazon have raised customer expectations for delivery times and convenience. Normalizing features like next-day delivery may increase order fulfillment efficiency, but also puts stress on other parts of the chain. Because orders can be made and received faster, they need to be delivered at an equally accelerated pace. This often leads to waste as companies over-order materials and then face a lower volume of orders. Machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation, among other technologies, have helped companies increase responsiveness to meet this increasing demand.

Traditional supply chains had a more localized, bottom-up approach that dictated work closer to the supplier. Amazon's backward vertical integration represents the opposite approach, in which the company started as a retailer and worked backward to become a publisher and partial owner of its distribution channel.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the diverse sourcing trend and placed an increased emphasis on inventory management and visibility. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will play an increasingly large part in diversifying supply change and improving the responsiveness and resiliency of supply chains, likely continuing after the economic shock from the pandemic has passed.

The pandemic may also cause economies to restructure their supply chains away from ultra-lean models that rely heavily on flexibility and network interconnectedness to provide product quickly.
What is supply chain management?

Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of a business’ entire production flow, from sourcing raw materials to delivering a finished item.

The global supply chain is a complex network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, wholesalers and customers. Effective SCM is about optimizing this network to ensure that everything gets where it needs to be, when it needs to be there—and as smoothly as possible. It includes obtaining the necessary components, manufacturing the product, storing it, transporting it and getting it to customers.

SCM also involves the coordination of external partners and both internal resources and operations management. According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), “in essence, supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies.”1

Why is supply chain management important?

Effective supply chain management minimizes costs, waste and time in the production cycle. It directly impacts profitability and allows businesses to gain a competitive advantage in today's global marketplace. One study found that organizations with advanced SCM capabilities were 23% more profitable than their peers.2

Supply chain management also helps companies anticipate and mitigate risks (such as supply chain disruptions) and track compliance with regulations and standards. By helping products arrive on time and in good condition, supply chain management can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

The importance of supply chain management is also evident amid growing awareness about climate change. Sustainable supply chain management can help companies reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment by optimizing logistics and energy management, and reducing waste.

Key elements of supply chain management

Supply chain management consists of several main components, including:
Planning

Planning involves forecasting demand, arranging production and managing inventory levels to ensure that the right products are ready to meet customer demand. It also involves setting an overall SCM strategy by determining metrics to measure whether the supply chain is efficient, effective and meets company goals. And it includes adapting to new product needs.
Sourcing

Sourcing involves identifying which providers to work with, negotiating contracts and managing supplier relationships to ensure a reliable supply of raw materials and components. The work includes ordering, receiving, managing inventory and authorizing supplier payments.
Manufacturing

Manufacturing involves organizing the supply chain operations required to accept raw materials, design and produce the product, and handle quality control.
Inventory management

Inventory management tracks inventory from manufacturers to warehouses and from these facilities to the point of sale. Inventory management aims to have the right products in the right place at the right time.
Delivery

Delivery involves the transportation and distribution of finished products to meet customer needs. It includes managing distribution centers, warehousing, order fulfillment and logistics.
Returns

Handling returns involves creating a network or process to take back defective, excess or end-of-lifecycle products. It includes managing reverse logistics and customer satisfaction, in addition to final product disposal.
Approaches to supply chain management

There are several strategic approaches to SCM. Companies can pursue different strategies based on their needs, budgets, capabilities and long-term goals and priorities. Common approaches include

    Lean supply chain management
    Agile supply chain management
    Six Sigma
    Total Quality Management (TQM)
    Resilient supply chain management
    Green supply chain management
    Digital supply chain management

Lean supply chain management

This approach focuses on eliminating waste in all forms, including excess inventory, unnecessary transportation and inefficient processes. The goal is to create a streamlined, cost-effective supply chain.
Agile supply chain management

This approach emphasizes quick response to changes in customer demand and market conditions. It often involves practices such as quick batch production, rapid replenishment and flexible supplier contracts.
Six Sigma

This approach is data-driven and aims to eliminate defects and reduce variability in supply chain processes. It uses statistical methods to identify and remove the causes of errors and minimize variability in manufacturing and business processes.
Total quality management (TQM)

This approach focuses on improving quality throughout the supply chain, with the goal of increasing customer satisfaction. It involves continuous improvement efforts and often includes practices such as supplier quality management and process standardization.
Resilient supply chain management

This approach focuses on building a supply chain that can withstand disruptions and adapt to changing conditions. It focuses on identifying potential risks in the supply chain and developing strategies to mitigate them. These strategies might include diversifying suppliers, creating contingency plans and investing in supply chain visibility tools.
Green supply chain management

This approach focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain and promoting social responsibility. It can involve practices such as sustainable procurement and participation in the circular economy.
Digital supply chain management

This approach uses technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced analytics to enhance various aspects of supply chain management, including demand forecasting, inventory management and logistics.
The role of supply chain managers

Supply chain managers play a critical role in maintaining the smooth operation of the supply chain. They are responsible for planning, implementing and controlling the efficient and effective flow of goods, services and information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

Professionals in this type of management work tend to deal with various challenges, including the growing complexity of global supply chain networks and an increasing number of risks and disruptions. People in this career path might also align the company’s supply chain strategy to meet sustainability goals.

Many companies face an SCM talent shortage as demand for skilled workers grows. For example, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the need for logisticians to increase 18% by 2032—more than five times the anticipated growth rate for all occupations.3

Supply chain managers must have a deep understanding of all parts of the supply chain and strong analytical and problem-solving skills. They might gain this expertise in SCM through university degrees (including master’s of business administration or bachelor’s degrees), certificate programs and experience in the industry. Areas for skilled knowledge include project management, logistics management, procurement, strategic sourcing, inventory management and demand planning or forecasting, along with operations management, analytics and supplier relationship management.
History of supply chain management

The concept of SCM emerged in the 1980s, but its roots go back to the creation of assembly lines in the early 20th century. Initially, SCM focused on improving manufacturing efficiency and reducing inventory levels. However, with globalization and advancements in information technology, today’s supply chains have evolved into complex networks spanning countries and continents.

The boom in e-commerce altered the dynamics of supply chain management. Over the years, the focus shifted from traditional retail-centric models to direct-to-consumer models. This shift requires more complex and agile supply chains to handle smaller, more frequent deliveries, often on a global scale.

Recent disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight the importance of risk management and resilience. As a result, companies are diversifying their supplier base, increasing inventory buffers and investing in technologies to improve visibility and responsiveness. And while globalization has expanded supply chains across borders, there is also a shift toward localization in response to trade tensions, higher transportation costs and the need for faster delivery times.
Supply chain management technology

The integration of new technologies is transforming the way that businesses manage their supply chains.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)

AI and ML revolutionized demand forecasting, allowing companies to predict sales with greater accuracy and adjust their production, inventory levels and pricing strategies accordingly. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants streamline interactions for improved customer experience. ML algorithms analyze collected data across the supply chain to identify bottlenecks, optimize routes and improve overall visibility.
Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT devices, such as sensors and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, collect real-time data on inventory levels, shipment tracking and asset performance. IoT-enabled smart warehouses are also becoming more common; they offer automated storage and retrieval systems, robotic picking and drones for inventory management.
Industry 4.0

IoT is also integral to the rise of Industry 4.0, a term used to refer to the digital transformation of manufacturing. Industry 4.0 incorporates new technologies such as digital-physical systems, augmented reality, cloud computing and advanced data analysis. Robotics and 3D printing streamline production and warehousing processes, reducing lead times and costs. Industry 4.0 capabilities allow for faster decision making, automation and customization at new levels.
Blockchain

Blockchain technology is enhancing supply chain transparency, traceability and security. By creating an immutable, decentralized ledger of transactions, the blockchain can help prevent counterfeiting, improve product safety and streamline compliance processes.
Innovative developments

Technologies such as 5G allow faster, more reliable data transmission, supporting the deployment of more advanced IoT devices and real-time monitoring systems. And autonomous vehicles, such as self-driving trucks and drones, will become more prevalent, reducing transportation costs and improving delivery times. Although still in early stages, quantum computing is shaping the future of SCM by solving complex problems and enabling more accurate simulations and scenario planning.
Supply chain management software

A range of SCM software products are emerging to support supply chain professionals. These software options include:

    Inventory management software

    Order management systems (OMS)

    Warehouse management systems (WMS)

    Transportation management systems (TMS)

    Demand planning software

    Supplier relationship management (SRM) software

    Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems

    Supply chain analytics software

    Supply chain visibility software

These tools streamline and automate processes such as procurement, production, logistics and sales, which in turn improves efficiency and reduces costs. For example, ERP systems provide real-time visibility into supply chain processes, enabling quick decision-making and optimization. Similarly, WMS and TMS help manage and control warehouse and transportatio
What Is Inventory Management?

In tandem with strong supply and demand planning, inventory management enables supply chain organizations to effectively track stock as it moves in and out of a given warehouse or warehouses. But what is inventory management? As products and goods are used or sold, an inventory management system updates itself so that organizations always have accurate numbers to go by. From replenishing stock to meet trending demands, inventory management is key to ensuring that there is always the right amount of product ⁠— not too much, and not too little ⁠— at any given time.
Why is inventory management important?

When inventories contain a surplus of product, it creates a disruption to the overall flow and knocks the supply-demand balance out of order. If there isn't enough product, the end customer suffers. If there’s too much product, the warehouse isn't able to take in other products that carry a demand, and the organization faces a disruption to its cash flow. This also spills into logistics (as well as concerns surrounding environmental sustainability), as deliveries may become more sporadic if inconsistent product counts are being shipped unnecessarily.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires all public companies to track their inventory, and the management of these processes must be documented in order to remain in compliance with SEC guidelines. This calls for a robust inventory management system to be implemented in order to both fulfill regulatory requirements and maintain organizational inertia.
inventory management
Types of inventory management

There are 13 different types of inventory that supply chain organizations deal with that call for a robust inventory management system. These include:
1. Raw materials

Unprocessed materials such as metals, plastics, and oils that aren't recognizable after product completion.
2. Parts and components

Screws, bolts, hinges, and other parts that are recognizable on their own before and after product completion.
3. Work in progress (WIP)

Products currently in production that may include raw materials, parts and components, packing materials and more.
4. Finished products

Completed items that are ready to be distributed and sold.
5. Maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) goods

Supplies used either in the manufacturing of products or to maintain the business or organization.
6. Packing and packaging materials

Primary, secondary, and tertiary packaging that protects products during the fulfillment process from manufacturer to end user.
7. Backup stock

Backup, safety or anticipation stock includes products, raw materials or inventory that an organization carries in order to cover any unexpected or sudden events or to take advantage of sale pricing.
8. Decoupling inventory

Spare items or works in progress that are kept at production line stations in order to eliminate any work stoppages.
9. Cycle inventory

The amount of inventory required to meet customer needs (normal demand) at any given time.
10. Service inventory

The number of services that can be provided within a specific timeframe.
11. Transit inventory

Products or items that are currently in transit either from a manufacturer, a warehouse or a distribution center.
12. Theoretical inventory

The minimum amount of stocked products that an organization needs to facilitate an entire process without needing to wait.
13. Excess inventory

Unsold or unused products that aren't expected to sell but need to be kept in storage.
Benefits of inventory management

    Cost savings. Knowing where products are being stored and how many are available in each location means organizations can pull strategically when customer orders are placed. This lessens the strain on logistics processes and enables organizations to ensure that unsold stock is minimized or even eliminated from the inventory management equation.
    Cash flow flexibility. Balanced inventory management means that new products are always coming in to replenish stock that is moving out. This ensures that organizations can maximize their cash flow capabilities to free up funds for other areas of the business.
    Customer satisfaction. Backordered products cause dissatisfaction among customers and end users, but good inventory management practices ensure that products are always available and can be delivered quickly.

Benefits of inventory management
Challenges of inventory management

    Accuracy. Software and automation have their limitations, one of which is maintaining continued accuracy in terms of inventory counts. If lost, stolen or damaged products are not recorded properly, supply issues can occur.
    Demand fluctuation. Economic shifts, time of year and more can affect demand for specific products which is why inventory management systems need to have the capacity and capability to track buyer trends over time.
    Physical storage. If products aren't organized and tracked well both in the system and in the warehouse, it will take more time to find and pull them to fulfill orders. This lowers employee productivity, disrupts the customer experience and adds unnecessary costs to the organization.

Working through the challenges can be cumbersome at times, but earning an APICS Certified in Planning and Inventory Management (CPIM) designation can help supply chain professionals better navigate the nuances of inventory management and decipher best practices that lead to increased productivity, improved cost efficiency and enhance the overall strategy of their organization's inventory management processes.
challenges of inventory management
Inventory management and supply planning/demand planning

Inventory management and supply and demand planning go hand in hand. When coordinated correctly, they also complement each other to help organizations achieve balance in their fulfillment processes. Supply planning enables better understanding of the challenges associated with bringing in new inventory without overstocking or running short supply; demand planning helps forecast the number of products that will be sold within a specific timeframe. Inventory management fits in right in the middle: By tracking all inventory that comes in and goes out, organizations always have access to accurate information to help with forecasting.
Inventory management and supply planning/demand planning
Inventory management versus inventory control

Inventory control focuses on the movement of products within a specific warehouse, while inventory management is the process of tracking inventory across an entire organization that may have multiple locations and warehouse facilities. While there are many processes that make up inventory management, inventory control is one that takes place at the warehouse level instead of the organizational level.
Inventory management versus inventory control
Example of inventory management

In 2019, power-management technologies company Eaton partnered with ASCM in order to develop and implement an enhanced learning process that would enable its employees to better address the challenges that come with inventory management. Eaton's main objective was to improve and optimize the flow of information and materials through its supply chain.

What Is Reverse Logistics?

Reverse logistics is an important aspect of supply chain management, which successful supply chain organizations use to execute operations efficiently and increase value for their end customers. By investing time into learning the different types of reverse logistics and the challenges involved in coordination and management, supply chain professionals can leverage their understanding to help lower costs and keep processes running smoothly.
What is reverse logistics?

Reverse logistics refers to the supply chain process of returning products from end users back through the supply chain to either the retailer or manufacturer. Whether the customer is returning items they don't need, the end of the product life cycle has been reached or the product is damaged or flawed, it's simply good business to offer returns to your customers, and that's where reverse logistics comes into play. This process also applies when items need to be either disposed of or recycled and includes the scenario where the end user is the one handling the refurbishment, disposal or even resale of the product in question.

Types of reverse logistics

Following are the main types of reverse logistics:
Returns management

The most common reverse-logistics process, returns management, deals with regular customer returns and should represent a seamless, hassle-free experience in order to boost customer loyalty and brand image.
Return policy and procedure

This is the policy against which all customer returns are measured, and it should be followed consistently by both customers and employees alike. It's good practice to keep these policies visible and easily accessible to customers.
Remanufacturing or refurbishment

Reconditioning products that are returned prevents organizations and retailers from forfeiting profit (or losing money) on defective products while eliminating unnecessary waste.
Packaging management

Organizations with packaging management processes are able to reuse packaging in order to reduce waste and save the cost that would otherwise be spent on new packaging for returned items.
Unsold products

Directly focused on returning items from end users or fulfillment centers back to manufacturers, the process of returning unsold products is commonly the result of delivery refusal, poor sales or could involve other factors.
End of service life

Some products need to be returned at the end of their useful life in order for manufacturers to manage their proper environmental disposal.
Delivery failure

If products cannot be delivered, they are returned to fulfillment centers where they may be shipped back to the manufacturer, however, it's possible for efficient organizations to manage delivery failure by correcting the issue and resending.
Rental equipment

Rented or leased products are returned at the end of a defined term and sent back to the manufacturer for either disposal, recycling or redeployment.
Repair and maintenance

Such as in the case of many consumer electronics (laptops, for example), products may be returned to have repairs or warranty work performed.
The reverse logistics process

The process used to manage the return of goods depends on the type of reverse logistics in question as well as the type of business the organization operates and in which industry. For example, a clothing retailer will often deal with generic customer returns, while a coffee pod manufacturer would offers customers a mail-back recycling program for used pods. Breweries use reverse logistics to gain back their keg canisters so that they can clean and refill them for further distribution. Each business should have its process mapped out to ensure maximum efficiency and to take advantage of any incentives for streamlining its reverse-logistics activities to increase environmental sustainability.

The five stages of reverse logistics
Process the return

When customers initiate a return, the organization must then initiate the return process and put their standard operating procedure in motion. Every company that deals with returns needs to have an organized method of initiating returns. This means outlining the step-by-step process that returned items will go through once they leave the hands of the customer or end user. Defining this stage can help organizations reduce unnecessary waste and pollution as a result of uncoordinated trucking.

Determine the return category

Upon return, products need to be inspected in order to determine where they should be placed next in the process. Once a product is returned there are a few options for next steps. It may need to undergo refurbishment, recycling or be prepped for resale to fill another order. Organizations that have streamlined their reverse-logistics processes will have systems in place to identify the issue and categorize the return before it arrives. For instance, at the initiation of a return, e-commerce giant Amazon asks its customers to indicate the reason, be it that the wrong item was shipped, the item is defective, the shipping materials were damaged or another issue. This enables the organization to process the return promptly.
Determine the return category
Move products to reduce waste

Continuously keeping returned products in motion can help to reduce the amount of waste produced when products sit for lengthy periods. Items due for repairs should be moved quickly to the repair department so that they are not left in the balance. The same applies to items requiring disposal or resale — these should be moved to the appropriate designated area where they can be managed and continue on their journey through the remainder of the supply chain as necessary.

Execute the repair process

Items relocated to the repair department should be dealt with in a timely fashion so that any necessary end-of-life arrangements can be made. Repairable items should be repaired quickly and reinstated into the organization's inventory or disposed of if they are irreparable. In the case where specific parts or components are still usable, these should be sold off to manufacturers to be used in the creation of new products.
Execute the repair process
Recycle items that cannot be repaired or resold

If it can't be fixed or parted out, it must be disposed of in the correct fashion. Organizations must do their due diligence when it comes to recycling and disposing of items that cannot be repaired. This means taking environmental sustainability into account and addressing issues that result from wasted products. Any component that can be recycled should be handled accordingly which may involve the disassembly of the product in full or in part.

The goal of successful reverse logistics

Regardless of the type of organization you represent, optimizing your reverse logistics can provide beneficial outcomes for both you and the environment. The goal of successful reverse logistics is to keep products moving in circularity so that manufacturing, distribution, shipping and delivery, returns, repairs and disposal can all remain in sync as part of a constantly spinning model of efficiency. Not only does this lower costs for organizations and subsequently their customers and end users, but it also reduces the number of products that end up in our landfills. By developing and adopting a solid reverse-logistics plan, your organization can create additional value for your customers by showing them how you manage these inevitable processes.
